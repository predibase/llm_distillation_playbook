Yep. I realised this a couple of days ago, which is why I took the play-nice gloves off. I was quietly informed (ironically, by someone who is part of a New Zealand-based meat-puppet """"gang"""") that my exclusion from Wikipaedia was inevitable due to the background petty politics that really run this place. Evidently, this is what they do when they conclude that an editor is causing too much damage to one of their causes.
Darkstar1st, thanx for your efforts on my behalf. I do suggest you stop bothering with the Libertarianism page - they're either grossly-obsessed ideologically-motivated fanatics or they are so incredibly stupid that NOTHING gets through to them. Either way, trying to reason with them is like trying to reason with disobedient children who are suffering from severe ADHD. And while I strongly distrust and dislike most of the left-wing gang, Jrtayloriv is one seriously disturbed individual. Watch your back with him - he has DEEEEEEP emotional issues (look how completely mental he became when I stopped responding to his petty taunts?) And Torchwood Who? is showing distinct signs of being one of Jrtayloriv's sock-puppets (what are the odds of two complete nutters starting to obsess over every detail about my Wiki history in precisely the same way and at precisely the same time?)

Brews, he's given citations for the very things that I have been arguing about. Polar coordinates in the inertial frame are the correct and standard way to analyze planetary orbital motion.

The section that I put in yesterday was standard textbook planetary orbital theory. I mentioned Goldstein's.

I can only conclude that most of the editors here are schoolboys who have done the basic circular motion theory and are totally unwilling to examine the general cases of curved path motion such as ellipses and hyperbolae and the role of the radially outward centrifugal force.

I would say that my section was erased yesterday for no other reason than that nobody here could understand it since they have never done planetary orbital theory in advanced applied maths at university.

 Garbo VIII 

Can't you delete these sections and start a new one? It takes 20 minutes just to scroll down to the end! Meanwhile, I'm really enjoying our conversation and hope it continues. take care,    
Done. (Some recent replies posted simultaneously in old section though).   

I see that you've changed Acosta back to de Acosta, which is fine since that's how she's identified in the Wikipedia entry. Vieira refers to her as Acosta. Other biographers refer only to Mercedes. Anyway, many surnames in the romance languages derived from placeslocations, like towns or territories. So it's like referring to her as """"of the seashore"""" instead of just """"Seashore."""" Anyway, I suppose both will do so I'm untroubled by your reversion. Don't really care.

The Acosta page needs to be updated based on a new biography of her by Bob Shanke, interestingly, a theatre historian. There there is also at least one major error in Wikipedia. The author says, """"The two [Garbo and de Acosta] were introduced to one another by de Acosta's lover at the time, author Salka Viertel."""" This assertion is simply false. Accd to the authors of the 3 biographies I read of G, Acosta didn't even know Viertel before she met G. G asked Viertel to introduce them and Viertel called Acosta up out of the blue. Oh well, at this point it's someone else's problem to correct. Well, maybe I'll correct this one thing since I'm at it here. I'm not interested in reading a bio of Acostaat least for the time being. I learned enough about her from the G bios. I'm trying to find time to rewrite the section agbout G's affairs but I have to read about them all over again for accuracy. Happy to see your anal self back at work! I know you're always there to review my revisions!  

Just made some changes and corrections to the Acosta page but it was stupid since the page is absolutely terrible. Hopeless. No citations, terribly written, completely untrustworthy. Author of new bio demystifies what he considers to be unfair characterizations of her (as basically an obnoxious irritant in G's life). She's not an insignificant figure in Hollywood and gay circles and deserves a better article. greetings,  
Yeah, I knew the de Acosta thing was questionable, which is why the unusually detailed (for me) edit summary. I first checked her article here, but didn't rely on it too much (probably would have stopped there for consistency if it had used just the """"Acosta"""" form though). Then various discussions on the MoS pages about da, de, di, Mc, Mac, van, and von ... the substance of which was """"it varies"""", so that's when I hit the NYT. Mostly the issue got fudged by referring to her throughout articles as """"Mercedse de Acosta"""", but two articles about her and one about a daughter (niece?) getting married used """"de Acosta"""" alone.

New project for me
Originally, I was going to write about Chicago mass transit because of a red link but I found out that there's already a good article on it by a slightly different name.  Thanks for the link.

I am going to write about Newton Minow, who has quite an interesting background.  He is in Chicago.  He's the Honorary Counsel General of Singapore to Chicago, has quite a law background, and headed the Federal Communications Commission at one time where he coined the term """"vast wasteland"""" for TV.  Nothing for you to do but it's my foray into Chicago related topics! """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Thank you for your contributions.

Currently, you are editing without a username. You can continue to do so, as you are not required to log in to Wikipedia to read and edit articles; however, logging in will result in a username being shown instead of your IP address (yours is 82.19.71.42). Logging in does not require any personal details, and there are many other benefits for logging in.

When you edit pages:

 Please respect others' copyrights; do not copy and paste the contents from webpages directly.
 Please use a neutral point of view when editing articles; this is possibly the most important Wikipedia policy.
 If you are testing, please use the Sandbox to do so. 
 Do not add unreasonable contents into any articles, such as copyrighted text, advertisement messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Adding such content or editing articles maliciously is considered vandalism.

The Wikipedia Tutorial is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. For now, if you are stuck, you can click the edit this page tab above, type {{helpme}} in the edit box, and then click Save Page; an experienced Wikipedian will be around shortly to answer any questions you may have. Also feel free to ask a question on . I will answer your questions as far as I can! Thank you again for contributing to Wikipedia.

 Why do you keep deleting a link to the most informative site about Middle Bass Island??? 

Norman,

you have removed the link to the main Middle Bass Island web site several times. That means you don't even look at the contents of the items you remove, which is rather petty and incredibly arrogant.

The site started as a non-commercial site and contains a great deal of island history as well as many, many island pictures. It's one of the most popular sites in the Lake Erie Islands.

Please take a look at """"Site Map Page 1"""" and """"Site Map Page 2"""" before removing the link again. Saying that the hundreds of pages listed there have only commercial value is idiotic.

The site was started out of love for the Lake Erie Islands and Middle Bass Island and the fact that it now carries a number of ads for island businesses does not change the fact that it is mainly a site with island information not available anywhere else.

So what is your real rationale for deleting it again and again and again???

 Definitions of Beat vs. No such thing as a """"Beat"""" artist, Round 2: The Formal Argument Edition! 

Now let's get down to some actual business. Formal argument is necessary because this argument has degenerated so far (by me, mostly, just for fun). I'll break it down piece by piece so it's easier to digest for people unwilling to read what others are saying:

Purpose of this argument: To fix a very serious problem with structure, clarity, and reader friendliness inherent in this page and in the topic as a whole. The problem is that the term """"Beat Generation"""" is used in multiple ways to the degree that it becomes confusing for the general reader and leads to arguments about who """"is"""" and """"isn't"""" a """"beat.""""

Proposal: We should fix the structure of the page 

Ginsberg Deliberate Prose:
""""The phrase 'beat generation' rose out of a specific conversation with Jack Kerouac and John Clellon Holmes around '50-51 when, discussing the nature of generations recollecting the glamour of the lost generation, Kerouac said, Ah, this is nothing but a beat generation ... not meaning to name the generation but to un-name it.""""

He discusses the origin of the term """"beat"""" in """"hip language"""" froom Huncke and then discusses how it became associated with """"beatific"""" in 1959 (and on a side note, that reinforces Doom's side of a previous disagreement, though Ginsberg says """"articulated"""" which could mean it was conceived of earlier).

""""A fourth meaning accumulated, that of the 'beat generation literary movement.' This was a group of friends who had worked together on peotry, prose and cultural conscience from the mid-forties until the term became popular natuionally in the late fifties. The group consisting of Kerouac ... Neal Cassady, William Burroughs ... Herbert Huncke, John Clellon Homes ... Allen Ginsberg, myself; we met Carl Solomon and Philip Lamantia in '48; encountered Gregory Corso in 1950, and we first saw Peter Orlovsky in 1954.

""""By the mid-fifties this smaller circle, through natural affinity of modes of thought or literary style or planetary perspective was augmented in friendship and literary endeavor by a number of writers in San Francisco, including Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen and a number of other powerful but lesser-known poets such as Jack Micheline, Ray Bremser, and ... LeRoi Jones  all of whom accepted the term at one time or another, humorously or seriously, but sympathetically, and were included in a survey of bet general manners, morals, and literature by Life magazine in a lead article in the late '50s by one Paul O'Neill, and by the journalist Alfred Aronowitz in a large series on the Beat Generation in the New York Post.

""""By the mid-fifties a sense of some mutual trust and interest was developed with Frank O'Hara and Kenneth Koch, as well as with Robert Creeley and other alumni of Black Mountain ...

""""The fifth meaning of the phrase 'Beat Generation' is the influence of the literary and artistic activities of poets, filmmakers, painters, writers and novelists who were working in concert in anthologies, publishing houses, independent filmmaking, and other media. Some effects of the aforementioned groups refreshed the bohemian culture which was already a long tradition (in film and still photography, Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie; in music, david Amram; in painting, Larry Rivers; in poetry publishing, Don Allen, Barney Rosset, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti) extended to fellow artists such as Susan Sontag and Norman Mailer."""" etc.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

""""The recidivism rate of TharkunColl is sad, for he has vowed to disrupt the Wikipedia to make a point. Here he attempts yet again, to blow smoke all our arses.""""

You are the one who is disrupting Wikipedia. I am upholding the consensus.

""""TharkunColl believes that the English and Welsh are not ethnic twins of Southern Britain (in the present day and age), perhaps unaware that they are indistinguishable to the world at large. The Principality of Wales has not been its own country since before Edward I of England, while the Principality of Liechtenstein is an independent country that has no real ethnic status different from its neighbours. His argument is to play up national-separatist sentiments that serve nobody in the present day, about a Principality vis a vis Kingdomwhich form bestows actual ethnic statuses to peoples. Wales has never been featured on the arms of state and seals of office that denote independence, the chief marker of separate identity among the nations in Europe. That the Welsh people page exists, doesn't qualify its existence. This guy believes that there is a sort of """"Anglo-Celtic subrace"""" of Europeans, that is defined only by the British Isles (an idea only popular among xenophobic yobbos proud of the British Empire's world domination, in an era circa the Great War). He believes that Brittany is part of the British Isles, rather than a former duchy in the Kingdom of Franceby choice over allegiance to England in the Breton War of Succession. He believes that mass settlement, colonisation and the transcendence of national cultures is arguable in favour of the people under Canute the Great's dominion as governed by Winchester, but denies any significance in relations from 1066 (until the present) as determined by London and what the Normans did which transformed the populace in all waysespecially ancestry and tongue, to form actual and extant connections with the French, Scots and Irishthe countries England has dealt with for the past millenium. He uses racial definitions in respect to the """"Celtic fringe"""" and their English relationship, for we all know how the English never held special favour to them until the Hanoverians changed the political climate and drew sympathy from the English for the harsh oppressions of that regime which never bred into the population of the British Isles and was """"naturally nativised"""". The user believes the Norman Conquest was as removed from the people as the Constitutional Hanoverian rule, but more bloody and causing a Marxist class struggle between monarch and subject for centuries as opposed to a few decades in which it was possible to secure their integration as part of the English people themselves. My other opponent User:Enzedbrit believes that the Norman Channel Islanders are no different from the English, but TharkunColl thinks they are foreigners (since 1066) compared to the Celtic fringe (whom only assimilated to the English way of life because of aftereffects created by the Norman Conquest of England). This person has attacked my nationality as Canadian and put my knowledge into question, simply because I'm not jingoistic to punish the French in any and every discussion of themwe in Canada have learnt to get along, because English and French are more alike than differentdespite intense rivalry. He tries to speak with authority and down to me, while it is obvious that he is a crank out of the mainstream of academic institutions but well within the realm of football hooliganism.""""

Read what I wrote. I believe that the Welsh and English are indeed very close, but quite obviously still retain separate ethnic identities. You are trying to say that they are English. For your own sake, please don't say that if you ever go to Wales. I have never made any claims about an """"Anglo-Celtic subrace"""" and nor do I believe Britanny is part of the British Isles. Why do you ascribe false beliefs to me? As for you being a Canadian, all it means is that you may have a completely false view of what the English are like, based on your misperception of history. As I said, just because Canada is an Anglo-French society, it doesn't mean that England is. And the only crank here is you I'm afraid.

""""I made a reference to the Tudors being England's chief representative of the Romano-British in England's culture and identity, which you think is ludicrous or have problems interpreting what was written. It was the Tudors who brought a revival of King Arthur, which made it an official mythology of England.""""

The Tudors lived about a thousand years after the Romano-British period, so to call them a representation of it sounds a tad unreasonable. And their revival of the Arthurian myths was purely political.

Details2: I can understand that you would like to have the whole thing rewritten to cast a more favorable light on TFI but your statement that nothing is all black or white does not fit with regards to your description of FFing. Berg's letters, his language, Marias language and letters, letters such as """"Make It Pay"""" """"God's Whores"""", The King Arthur Series, and many many more, make it clear that FFing was prostitution with a sordid twist of Jesus being behind it all.

Oh Mark, for shame! Why lie? I didn't get banned from the Clitoris article for any such thing. I didn't get banned from it at all. I was banned from removing the picture that upset several editors. You pretended you had a """"unanimous"""" """"consensus"""" then too. I didn't constantly run any polls. That's a downright lie too. Why would I? I don't think polls demonstrate consensus and I oppose their use to settle content disputes. I've expressed that view many, many times. The dispute on clitoris in fact centred around a group of editors who were bullying minority-view editors because they had won a vote. They largely refused to discuss the salient issues because, they believed, they had won a vote and that was that. (Careful Tony Sidaway watchers will note that on Talk:Clitoris he was insistent that winning a vote was the same as having a consensus but on Talk:something about B roads, he had changed his tune and thought that votes were evil. Like most of the people who voted here, it's one rule when it fits your POV, another when it doesn't.) This title is shockingly POV. That you can line up a bunch of editors who share the POV that it pushes to vote and say no it's not doesn't actually not make it so, but I've given up trying to get editors to accept that the proZionist stance that is so common in your home country is not actually """"neutral"""".

Hello, I'm a moderate user of wikipedia. My Opus for this site has to be the article I wrote on Cobden, Ontario. This is my home town and I did a lot of research into it's history and everything so that I could make a good article on it. I have received a lot of comments from people in my town about the article and a lot of them have told me they learned things that they didn't know before. Recently a user named Bearcat has merged a lot of stub articles into the article about their region. I'm not sure what the policy is on this. Most of the articles were about very unnotible places (mclarens settlement being the best example). But I'm a little unclear on why he seems to insist on merging cobden aswell. The article was over 10,000 words long. I know that there doesn't need to be articles on everything on earth but, and I realize I may be the minority on this, it seems like towns  should have their own articles. I mean.... people may want information about them and it was hard for me to find it all. Now the information is all broken up and scattered across the whitewater region article. 

Anyways, the reason I'm bothering you with this is because you seem like you would probably know a little more about wikipolicy than me and I saw you get involved before. I guess you could say I'm asking for your help and opinion. And my main question is this: Are towns not worthy, ever, of their own article?

 Arundhati Roy's controversial comments on Gujarat riots in 2002 missing in """"Advocacy and controversy"""" section 

Hi,

Arundhati Roy's comments on Gujarat riots of 2002 that came in Outlook magazine when the riots were happening, which got very high media attention, when the enquiry proved false and subsequent apology was published in the same magazine, are one of the biggest controversial statement ever issued by her, which triggered widespread violence during the riots, is missing from """"Advocacy and controversy"""" section of the wikipedia article about 'Arundhati Roy"""".

Some of the comments in the article published in the Outlook magazine were 

""""Last night a friend from Baroda called. Weeping. It took her fifteen minutes to tell me what the matter was. It wasn't very complicated. Only that Sayeeda, a friend of hers, had been caught by a mob. Only that her stomach had been ripped open and stuffed with burning rags. Only that after she died, someone carved 'OM' on her forehead.""""

""""A mob surrounded the house of former Congress MP Iqbal Ehsan Jaffri. His phone calls to the Director-General of Police, the Police Commissioner, the Chief Secretary, the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) were ignored. The mobile police vans around his house did not intervene. The mob broke into the house. They stripped his daughters and burned them alive. Then they beheaded Ehsan Jaffri and dismembered him. Of course it's only a coincidence that Jaffri was a trenchant critic of Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, during his campaign for the Rajkot Assembly by-election in February.""""

The link you added on the DJ Peterson page is broken.  Also, the information you added is incorrect.  Zunino was drafted 3rd overall.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.16.215.84   
 I fixed the link. Also, the information was initially correct when I first added it, but a later edit made the sentence incorrect: Peterson is the highest drafted player in New Mexico Lobos history, not Mariners. 24Mati 

 Your revert of my edit on the page about Roblox 

I should have cited my other sources. Those include Youtube, and items on Roblox (decals, models)

Youtube 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJEJNoxoiIQ

Youtube 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLy5FCJZIng
Decal 1: http://www.roblox.com/April-Fools-Smile-item?id=76579753

  
 YouTube videos are not considered reliable, as anyone can upload a video and make a claim. The Decal is also not a reliable source, since the description itself is not enough, and like YouTube, self-published sources are not considered reliable. For the hacking incident, the only way for it to be mentioned here is through either a reliable source, like a news group, or by the developers itself. I believe the game's developers have a blog, which can be accessed from the site itself, and if one of the developers wrote a blog entry about it (a passing mention is not notable), it can be added. 24Mati 

 Erm, here the blog: http://blog.roblox.com/2012/04/april-1st-site-issue-and-update/ — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
 Alright, thanks for providing it. While the blog does mention the eventual shutdown due to """"site issues"""", I doubt it'll be enough to be added to the article, since one who's new to Roblox and reading the page would believe it was just for routine maintenance, when it was much worse; David Baszucki didn't say exactly what the cause was, which - in the case of the videos - was various hackings, it seems, and you can't add in details that the source doesn't provide. For the most part, if you can find another blog post from the developers, or a reliable source (as I said, a news agency, for example), that actually explains what happens, then it might merit inclusion. 24Mati

 Twitter and Wikia usually are not reliable sources, especially the latter, like Wikipedia. As I had said, if you can find a reliable source, like a news agency, that discusses the hackings in detail, then it might be considered. Blog posts from anyone not affiliated with Roblox, profiles and tweets are not enough. 24Mati

 Notable != Important 

Hello, . Please don't use the word """"important"""" when talking about notability, as you did at WP:HD#Zeeshan haider. In this case it probably doesn't matter, because the issue is that the article doesn't make a claim of notability. But when an article is deleted (or rejected) because the subject is not notable, new users often come back with something like """"How can you say X isn't important?!"""" The answer is that that isn't what we're saying: 'notable' has a technical meaning in Wikipedia, and does not mean 'important', 'influential', 'popular', or any of the other things that people might interpret it as being in the normal sense.

 Well, hope the floor didn't hurt. But your characterization of my attitude and what I respect and don't is to say the least dubious. Did it occur to you that I didn't attend your schools, have different experiences, different parents, and can think for myself? There is plenty of room for differences in interpretation, as anyone that has mediated flame wars here, as I have can tell you. One cranky old editor spouting off does NOT make for a battle. OTOH, similar frank opinions have almost universally in the past resulted in a good working relationship, a clear communication, and about 3/4ths of the time, resulted in a new Wikifriend. So piffle to WP:CIVyou're not looking at the context, nor the intent of the context for that guideline. Being polite can in fact be counterproductive and a time waste, a matter of judgmentmine, as the observer. Take Quiddity (who signed up at page top for example) who once demonstrated a unbelievable tendency to pro-offer unwarranted judgments and unsolicited advice. Ultimately, I had to get firm with him and sent this, which he threatened to post, SO I DID. Nothing there to be ashamed of, you see. Bottom line... there are some people in this world that need rapped along side the ear to get their attention. There are others that need to have their toes stepped on, UNTIL THEY APOLOGIZE. Both those types benefit some by being jerked up by the shorthairs. Failing all else, it makes me feel better, and communicates at least one person, however crazy they may think me, has less than steller appreciation for their actions as they impact othersnormally others time. I really don't get excised much here about anything else. Endless editing and all that, after all.Sooooo, Thanks for the appeal to my vanity, but I suggest in the future you counsel people to examine whether a situation is ongoing, escalating, or one time episode of venting. I spent 2-1/2 years here acting as a mediator myself, and would never have considered involving myself in an isolated message based case. Not sensible. Call it justifiable road rage if you like—a real world situation here in cyber space, and  at least I cleaned up the vulgarity of what I had written in the first three drafts, to make my loathing judgment of his lazy rape of hundreds of pages plain. THAT is where I put my loyalty and focus. NOT on one of thousands of arguable interpretation of various guidelines and policies. If your INTERPRETATION of WP:CIV prohibits any colorful idiom or addressing a dumbshit-thing-to-do as a dumbshit act, I'm definitely done here. I'm floored that you haven't the imagination to understand that— save for the hyperbole about kicking ass, a deliberate attempt to indicate how poorly I viewed the 5-6 hours a day of well over six weeks of effort fixing his rape pogrom allegedly following guidelines — nor the fact that you were all being busy-bodies making much ado about nothing. One of the most reprehensible facts about contributing here is that there is a total insensitivity to the leisure time our contributors make, particularly by 'blithely accepting actions', one way or another, deleting their hard work and effort, which is about as personal an attack as one can make... Show me where NPA THE LEAST SENSITIVE to that VERY REAL, VERY PERSONAL virtual 'slap in the face'.  And fools wonder why we have editor retention rate problems! Wake the fuck up. THAT IS A REAL WORLD PROBLEM, not my slight episode of 'hitting' to administer a lesson in courtesy to others. (Call me twisted, but a single discourtesy to me  administered to make the point is properly due those who exercise the ultimate discourtesies, really without due process. Making 180 article pages into redirects without involving the community at large in the decision is to me, WP:BOLD applied way over the top. AFD or MFD should have been invoked, at the least. Not one talk page and three or four editors without a direct attempt to re-involve the originator of same articles, or their major contributors. BOTH THOSE badly need a quorum count provision, but I digress, the digression.) Those articles nearly 200 some were something apparently dozens put up... involving hundreds of man-hours and were well crafted. Oh, they needed some cites for a few fannish statements of cause and effect, but the necessity of that is itself doubtful in cultural articles about recently produced intellectual efforts.

 Third Estate ?  National Assembly ? 
Re: ''The Tennis Court Oath (serment du jeu de paume) was a pledge signed by 577 members of France's Third Estate on June 20, 1789. .... 

this was an important factor in the coming of the french revolution the members swore that they wouldn't disband until Louis XVI had granted a constitution for the people of france.

 aaaaaaaaaah why are you changing it?!!!! 

Im not sure but i think the oath was written by Abbe Sieyes? 

 Slight Change 

Changed the wording from leave to disband
Saying that they would not leave until they had written a constitution gives the impression that it was written all in one night, This is not true to took along to write a constrictions for France
Also and interesting fact; the tennis court is speculated to having been in actuality a handball court

Well obviously this article over the past few days has been totally vandalized and stripped of its information.  Somebody tried to rewrite the entire, and what used to be complex and informative article quickly as nobody seems to have a saved copy of the article.  In need of some Wiki admins.  

Hello, Mehicdino! I'm not sure whether you're  (talk • contribs), who edited the article to """"remove immature/incorrect text"""". However, can either one of you be more specific with what is inaccurate?

Most everything in the article looks correct. Granted, I'm not an expert on this subject, but given that the revision only removed minimal details, which seem correct, and also removed many of the wikilinks, I've gone ahead and reverted back to the previous version for now. Can you clarify on what is incorrect? Thanks!  (A note?) 

 Vandalism should never require a rewrite, as it's very easy to revert to a previous version.  

No, I am not the IP you state I could be because it does not match mine.  I was just saying a few days ago somebody actually put much effort into vandalizing this article to a pile of rubbish.

 No personal attacks 

Hi there TripWire, though I understand that you may have strong opinions about Balochistan, or Pakistan, or both, resorting to personal attacks as you have here where you mock another user's English skills, or here where you attempt to denigrate another user by calling him a little girl, are not constructive. (I'll also point out that calling someone a """"little girl"""" is sexist because you are implying that girls are inferior to boys.) If you wish to participate in serious discussions like this, you need to keep a level head, and you can't resort to name-calling. Comment on the content, not the contributor.

da6c27ddd2d07632,"Timeline Links 

Hi Minderbinder,

I am new to posting on wikipedia, and you recently deleted all of my links that I have added.  I have read the links you posted in my talk section, and appreciate your concern and commitment to keeping the external links on wikipedia relevant and non-commercial. I support you in that effort.

However, you mistakely assumed I am associated commericially with OurStory, which I am not.  Additionally, none of the links I posted attempt to earn me any money.  The timelines I manage are freely open to the public to browse and reference.  

I am a biographer by hobby, and am using the OurStory service beacuse I like the timeline they provide.  It is a service that I couldn't find else where on the web, and as a history buff and biographer, I think it is valuable.  I run a number of profiles on their service, which are told collaboratively with other people on the site, and I particpate in other people's biographical projects.

I do respect the fact that external links should provide information that positively adds to the discussion, or provides valuable information that is not already in the entry.  And I understand that in some cases the information on my timeline projects does this and sometimes it does not.  So, in respecting this, I will only add my links back to entries where I think my timeline provides valuable (or missing) information on that subject, for the wikipedia user. You can see my comments on those individual discussion pages.

But, as a final thought, I hope that you can appreciate that, in and of itself, a biographical (graphical) timeline is a useful external reference tool.  It is something I have been looking for for a long time.  For example, when I created my biography on Barack Obama, in my research I could not find a biographical web source that provided dates for important events that make up his life (including the wikipedia entry, offical Illinois sentate, or US Sentate biographies, or even his current campaign page).  There was nowhere I could go to get a sense of the major events in his life, without reading 3 pages of text.  So, in a case like that, I think the timeline is an external reference that is contributing to the entry.

If you think it is best, I can alter the way I leave links, so that it does not say Our Story in it.  I just followed the example that is widely used on wikipedia for external links to IMDB.

If you would like to further the general discussion, please post on my Talk page again.  And, please engage me on the discussion page for the individual entries where I am adding the links back.  If you plan on re-deleting them, please review the timeline first, and provide a reason why you feel it is not worthy of being listed.

Thank you!",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 my apologies 

Hello Anne, I left a correction over on the WP:RETENTION talkpage, but I wanted to say my sorry here as well.  

""""I wish to protest the role that 74 appears to be assigning to me here... Following another editor around and cleaning up his or her (deliberately left) messes would be boring""""  

I did not mean to speak of you now, I was specifically thinking of Anne Delong in December 2012.  Although not yet replied on the talkpage, I'm currently reading through your first 500 edits, which make sense given your paragraphs in the Anne Phenomenon section.  

I absolutely disagree when you say following editors around and fixing their messes is boring.  You worked on your own Opera article... and while it was waiting in the queue... made 15 grammar-nazi sniper-fixes to other articles in the queue.  This was 2012-12-26 that I'm thinking of.  You came back to wikipedia, every hour, for hours and hours.  *That* is where you got addicted to wikipedia.  *That* is why you still help out at AfC.  In my oh-so-not-humble opinion, that day is the keystone which explains the Anne Delong Phenomenon.  

I want to re-create that day.  Help me phrase my explanation on the WP:RETENTION talkpage, so that I capture what it is that brought you to love wikipedia.  Hope this clarifies, and apologies for mischaracterizing your contributions now, when I should have been clear I was thinking of you back when you were just starting out.  74.192.84.101  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Please note that repeated attempts to remove sourced material from articles is likely to be considered to be edit warring, which may result in your being blocked from further editing of Wikipedia either temporarily or permanently.  If you try to make a significant change to an article, and somebody else reverses it, the appropriate thing to do is to go to the talk page, have a reasoned discussion, and try to come to a joint view of what is the best way forward for the article (see WP:BRD).  Merely trying to ram through the change you want to make by altering the article again and again is not acceptable, and will lead to sanctions being applied.

For the moment, the article Haplogroup O-M176 (Y-DNA) has been locked for two weeks, so that no-one may edit it.  If you sincerely believe that there are issues with some of the material being presented, please discuss your concerns on the talk page, and try to find an acceptable way forward.  Note, however, that WP exists to make accessible material that has been published in what it considers to be reliable sources.  If the material appears significant and relevant to the article, and has been published in a legitimate academic journal, normally one would expect to find it included in the article.  Even if the material is questionable, if it is in wide circulation and often presented in discussions of the topic, then on those grounds alone it should still be included.  If there are good grounds for questioning the material, those grounds can be discussed in the article  but note that they must reflect the position of reliable sources that have been published and can be referenced, not just your own personal beliefs, knowledge, or unpublished research. (See WP:NOR for more information).

I am having an issue. On the 26th of august the following statement was removed from the Foresters Falls, Ontario article: Foresters Falls is now a small community having digressed significantly since the invention of motorized transport. 
This information was removed without any explanation. Because it is a factual peice of information I replaced it (aug 28th) and for safety sake put the book I had gotten it from as a referance. I explained my edit as """"Facts are facts"""". I imagined that the matter would end here. Why would anyone insist on its removal after this point? The next day I saw that it had been removed again by the same user who explained """"if it's a fact cite a reliable source"""". A simple enough request. I thought I had already done that but no matter. I renamed referances as sources, re-added the sentance again, explained this and left it. Within the hour my edit had been reverted and a message left on my user board saying """"Your change to the page Foresters Falls, Ontario was determined to be unhelpful, and has been reverted"""". Needless to say I was a bit upset. Who determined this? who's POV about Foresters Falls is more important? What criteria are being used? I understand that the statement is not the most important ever but it certainly doesn't detract from the article. I have been attempting to have the user ArmadilloFromHell explain why he insists on it's absence but he is being very stubborn and will not answer my questions. I don't want to start harrassing people but I have no idea what to do. Here are a few of my questions:

has the community not gotten smaller? 
was it not caused by the automobile? 
have I not sourced the statement as asked? 
is it not a fact? 
is it not information? 
does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was? 
is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present? 
is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not? 
Why it is better to not have the statement than to have it? 
Does this information not answers a pertinant question left open by the article? 
If I were to refrase the sentance would that be better? 
What criteria was used to determine that it should be removed? 
Why insist on the removal of this perfectly sensible statement?

The primary goal of the case based textbook is to inform doctors of what to do when they are asked to perform different medical operations. The case based textbook only has one chapter on circumcision. Its primary goal is to inform doctors of how to react in the case they are asked to perform a circumcision. It does not give an overview of questions that have been raised about the procedure, and doesn't cover sources of controversy in the medical field (only debates). This makes it unfit to speak for this topic. Maybe it would be better to use it to highlight another statement involving controversies in the medical field.

The second source titled Controversies with one author is ok, as it does go over some medical controversies that exist, notably in consent and the parental role.

I think a better sourcing for this statement """"Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and autonomy have been raised over non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision.[8][9]"""" would be one that highlights significant questions from community groups in a specific demographic. If we could get a source that is clearly indicating that these questions are being raised that would be better.

Regarding your comments on my revision of the Endicott-Johnson page that you started

Nimur wrote: I am considering creating a separate article for the Carousels of the southern tier. I have some old photographs of the Carousels (I believe it was a 75th anniversary celebration, circa 1999). I am wondering if we should create a separate article (given that the region is known as the Carousel Capitol of the World). Otherwise, I can post them here, or in the respective city articles. Let me know what you think. Thanks for your excellent content and edits, Mahatmabenfoo! Nimur 

Mahatmabenfoo replied: Hi, Nimur! I can't figure out yet how to contact you, so hopefully you will read this. First, thanks for the compliments! I don't live in Johnson City anymore, but I have an ongoing interest in the area, and visit it periodically. I have a collection of pictures and postcards of the E-J plants, but I haven't learned to upload them yet.

A separate article about the Carousel Capitol of the World makes sense. Many people who will be interested in the Carousels of the triple cities will have little interest in E-J who's factories are now mostly long gone.

I suggest you leave the very short treatment I gave the subject (as an enduring legacy of Endicott-Johnson), but yes, yes! a link to a separate more in depth article would be terrific. There's a lot to say about Carousels generally, and what percentage of the total of wood carved ones are in the Triple Cities area, and all that. I'll happily leave all that to you, and I'll be happy to send you what research I have on the chance you will want to use it. For example, how's this as an amazing bunch of (what are probably) facts: Between 1880 and 1930, the golden age of carousels, over 10,000 were built. Fewer than 200 remain and six of them are in Broome County! Nationwide only 13 carousels remain at the site where they were originally built, five of those are in Broome County (the Highland Park carousel was originally at Ideal Park now the site of U-E football stadium).

I came across the Kolyma article while checking out some facts presented in a Danish newspaper article and was surprised to see that it had been marked as lacking neutrality in view of assertations made about the Kolyma Gulag (without reliable references, etc.). As I believe it is extremely important to ensure that the story of the Gulag is presented properly, I have spent a few hours on this article. The main problem seems to be that the author is not too familiar with Wiki editing. So I have begun to straighten a few things out - in particular correct internal links to the authors cited, additional links to the outside world and some footnoting. It would be great if some of the experts on Russia and Russian (Soviet) history could chip in too.
There has been a suggestion that the geographical page on Kolyma should be separated from the article on the Gulag. Sooner or later, I think we should do that but the immediate problem is one of establishing the authenticity of the current write-up.
I found it interesting that of all the Kolyma articles in other languages - and there are currently 16 (see http://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolima) - only two (French and Catalan) describe the Gulag. Poland has a special page on this.
I look forward to hearing from interested parties.
 Thank you for your effort in cleaning this up. I had several concerns about how these historical topics are reflected in the Wikipedia, in particular:
 Gross inflation of casualty numbers (I think the current version is more or less ok for that)
 Use of strong emotional terms to describe an encyclopedic subject, which is completely unacceptable in my opinion. List the numbers, the facts and let the reader do the math. There is a little bit of that left in the current version, but it's probably ok now, too.
 Biased representation of the camps as working only to destroy as many people as possible, and comparison to Nazi death camps. The goal of the Soviet system was to industrialize the country in 10 years (something that the Western countries covered in two centuries before that), and to prepare for the inevitable large-scale war against countless aggressors  Germany, the US, Japan, etc, each of whom has invaded Russia just two decades prior to that. To that end, the most important purpose of the camps was to build the industry that has later launched the man in space and up to this day is in the heart of modern Russia, and to manage to do so in complete isolation and with very few available resources, before getting attacked. The brutality of the methods is very regrettable, but should be mentioned in an objective article along with the actual productive goals of the program, and the benefits the country has reaped, although at a very, very high price.
 Drawing most of the information from Solzh's Gulag and dissidents' accounts, who most certainly should not monopolize the license for eternal truth. As I mentioned in the page's discussion, eyewitness accounts are important, but not the only one and by far not the most objective source of info. If you record testimony of 227 inmates of Abu Ghraib or Guantánamo Bay, they will say that those places are hell on Earth, the most mercilessly terrorized, particularly sadistic and the most unimaginably cruel human-run organizations, and the whole US concentration camp system is """"evil"""", as, they would probably claim, are the US themselves. This alone would not make a good article on Guantánamo Bay. 
 Furthermore, Solzh's book was used as an ideological weapon against the 70's and later Soviet Union to present even the second part of the 20th century in Russia as one endless deadly torture and gulag, which is, of course, a complete nonsense.
Given that hysterical overestimation and bias are very common in the West when it comes to these topics, I long ago gave up on trying to thoroughly improve related pages, because every time it sparks an endless flame war with people who tell me about tens and hundreds of millions of fictional casualties, and then my edits get erased or lost in the never-ending stream of b.s. So now I only do minor corrections, and appreciate when people try to constructively research the topic. If the arguments I presented here would help you in your further editing, then good; if not, then Wikipedia will remain a place of hysterical hatred for anything Soviet, especially in comparison to much more mellow and well-researched Britannica and Encarta.  
I appreciate these comments and will certainly bear them in mind for future editing.

I don't have the time or interest to get deeply involved in this article.  It seems to have been a battleground for those wishing to ridicule """"birthers"""" and the birthers themselves.  But I will say this: if you compare the WSJ piece to a lot of the sources in this article, it seems quite neutral.  Looking at the lead alone, footnotes 8, 11, and 14 look pretty opinionated to me.  And note that I used in-text attribution for the WSJ piece, as is commonly done for other opinion sources later in this article, but you removed the in-text attribution.
Anyway, rather than become a bigger  target for relentless charges of POV, quote-mining, and all the rest, which I think would be more aptly hurled at much of the existing text in this article, I'll not reply further.

Let us examine what is considered """"Black"""" in the context of this very article. At the very top it states:

""""It is also used to categorize a number of diverse populations together based on historical and prehistorical ancestral relationships. Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent Sub Saharan African descent (see African diaspora). Among the members of this group, dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural afro-hair texture (although a recent scientific study notes that human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations). Other definitions of the term """"black people"""" extend to other populations characterized by dark skin, including some indigenous to Oceania and Southeast Asia""""

This article even mentions Oceanians and Southeast Asians (such as the Great Andamanese, Native Fijians, the Ati,  and the Melanesians) even though these groups genetically have more in common with neighboring Asian populations and are very distant from other people who are considered Black Africans. Ethiopians are black Africans. Some of them have Middle-Eastern ancestry (Ethiopia is a short boat ride from Arabia), but that automatically does not make them an entirely mixed population; nor does it change the fact that their roots are mainly in Africa. Sicilians have some Middle-Eastern ancestry, but they are still considered European. Ancient Romans certainly referred to Ethiopians as black. They used the term """"Ethiopian"""" to describe all Black Africans they came across, regardless of their location outside of East Africa (read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_expeditions_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa)

I went to the Beta Israel page and found two very clear references: 

Ephraim Isaac (1974), The Falasha: Black Jews of Ethiopia. Dillard University Scholar Statesman Lecture Series.

Simon D. Messing (1982). The Story of the Falashas """"Black Jews of Ethiopia"""". Brooklyn. ISBN 0-9615946-9-1

Here's more from another article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Israel#Black_Hebrew_Israelite_immigration)

Rebhun, Uzi, Jews in Israel: contemporary social and cultural patterns

""""The Israeli government has airlifted black Ethiopian Jews to Israel and given them citizenship in the same way it has been a haven to Jews oppressed throughout the Middle East and Africa""""

""""She told RT: “They don't want poor or black children and Depo-Provera gave them the opportunity to have control. If she [a patient] keeps taking an injection every three months, she is not going to have children – you know it is a 100 per cent secure from children I think.”

Hedva says the policy is working – the number of black babies in Israel is decreasing, but there are no official statistics to back up her claim. For community workers and Ethiopian women here, statistics are unnecessary – they feel their reality speaks for itself.

The Health Ministry admits it issues the drug, but says it was never its policy only to administer it to Ethiopian women and reduce the number of black babies in the country.""""

I would say that makes Ethiopian Jew's a valid part of this article.

Thank you Gwen for re-stating my reply to Jdlund. I also complied with your previous block. As to Jimbo Wales and his claims of """"years of disruption on this article"""", those are his opinions, however, 70% of the facts in the article are based on my contributions, including my photos of the tower (before the university corrupted the tower with it's cages and remodeling the interior to something way beyond what it looked like at the time of the tragedy. Paint, cages and other cover-ups can not remove the actual history. Sure there have been previous wars over the content. I have been involved for over thirteen years getting the documents, interviews and real history of the tragedy, while trying to correct the media's versions, which are full of errors and out right misinformation. If some of the articles on the net and in the history of the media were used, Houston McCoy would be """"George McCoy"""", Whitman would be the Devil or evil (read Gary Lavergne's """"Why Did He Do IT"""" on his website (this is the author of """"A Sniper In The Tower"""", who claimed the tower tragedy was the """"Worst Mass Murder In American History"""", which I fought and proved that Andrew Kehoe was the worst until Whitman). Also, in Lavergne's article, he claims Whitman would be alive as of August 1, 2006, if the Supreme Court had not banned the death penalty a few years after the tragedy, even though Whitman had a Glioblastoma Grade IV brain tumor that would have killed him within a year - even if he had not gone up in the tower. All Jimbo Wales has ever done is react to the protests and misguided rule benders like BZUK and Gavia immer, who know nothing about the tragedy or the rules of a valid contribution. They (Gavia and BZUK), are just like Wales, memes who have no knowledge of what they are doing, just applying their own personal bias' for what they blindly consider acts of vandalism, with no proof, and not even looking at the contribution and it's sourcing.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Your make a good point.  Let me first address it from the perspective of Marshall Hodgson.

Civilization is a somewhat arbitrary term, often narrowly defined by language.  This obviously has its limits.  On the other hand, the more broadly you define a civilization, the more subgroupings it must include.  Eventually, we come to see civilizations as groupings useful for the purpose at hand.  And ultimately, civilizations, like religions, are self-defined.

Hodgson considers the lands of Islam to constitute a world civilization.  He calls Islam a world civilization in the title of his book The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization.

For another perspective, I can turn to H. Patrick Glenn, in Legal Traditions of the World, speaking on tradition and identity.  Not all is arbitrary in the definition of a tradition, or civilization.

Glenn quotes Fernand Braudel, who speaks of an """"underlying structure"""" of civilization; """"those elements of a civilization which could not be changed without a fundamental change, or more probably disappearance, of the tradition itself.""""  Applying this criteria to Islamic civilization, one immediately understands that structure to be the religion of Islam.

To summarize: looking at the lands of Islam, with its concept of Umma, the shared traditions, the shared Arabic religious and often secular language, and indeed the shared religion of Islam, it seems logical to fall in with those who perceive the outline of a world Islamic civilization.

 0-by-0 matrix 

(I'm starting a new subsection to distinguish my comments from the previous unsigned section.)

Because of the connection with linear transformations, it is important to allow 0-by-n and n-by-0 matrices.

In response to MattTait, the determinant of the unique 0-by-0 matrix is not 0, but 1.  There are several ways to see this:
If one defines the determinant as a sum over permutations of products of entries, there is one permutation of the empty set, and the corresponding product is the empty product, which is 1.
If one wants the computation of determinants by expansion by minors to work on nonzero 1-by-1 matrices, the determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix must be 1.
One can also compute how the corresponding linear transformation multiplies 0-dimensional volume.
The determinant of a block matrix 
A 0
0 B
is the product of det(A) and det(B).  For this to hold when A is 0-by-0 and B is a nonsingular matrix, one must define det(A)=1.   

 Order of a matrix 

I don't think this use of """"order"""" is common in current mathematical literature.  To me, a matrix of order 3 would more likely be a matrix M such that M^3 = I.  I think it is better to stick with the standard terminology """"dimensions"""".   

 F^{n x m} 

I think it is more common to write , not , for the space of m-by-n matrices with entries in F.  (I do understand that it is in bijection with linear maps from  to .)   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The intro paragraphs are good, but they could be a lot better.  I think that right now there's too much of a technical sound to it, as opposed to something more educational and inviting to people trying to learn about the subject.  I'd just like you to compare/contrast with the following paragraph, which is how evolution is introduced in a Bio101 textbook:

(Fair use excerpts follows)
Evolution originated with Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species...He argued from evidence that the species of organisms inhabiting Earth today descended from ancestral species.  Second, he proposed a mechanism for evolution which he termed natural selection, the idea that organisms can change over the generations if individuals having certain heritable traits leave more offspring than other individuals.  ..In modern terms, we would say that the genetic composition of the population had changed over time, and that is one way of defining evolution.  But we can also use the termin evolution on a much grander scale to mean all of the biological history, from the earliest microbes to the enormous diversity of modern organisms.

An understanding of evolution informs every field of biology, and applications of evolutionary biology are transforming medicine, agriculture, biotechnology and conservation...Evolution integrates all of biology.
(above is for example purposes onlywe can't use this in the article.)

We can't use the above since it would be fair-use, but do you see what I mean about making the article more accessible?

Another thing I'd note about the above example is that it also makes Evolution sound more exciting.  Just because we are an encyclopedia doesn't mean we can't put the subject in the exciting, important context that it deserves.

We could use something closer to the above, and then dive into a description of how the Theory of Evolution (what you might call a description of the fact of evolution that's described above) has developed from Darwin's original theory to modern-day explanations (and at the same time state how the question of whether evolution occurs has been a relatively incontroversial fact amongst biologists for the better part of a century).",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

It is unfair to use critical quotes from websites of other religious organizations because of the obvious bias. Quotes should be either from notable newspapers, magazines and books (self-published books not included).

 Proposing renaming and new article draft 

Over the last couple of months I have produced a new draft of this article, working on behalf of New Leaders. The organization asked me to write an updated draft, better reflecting their new name and current programs and bringing the article into line with Wikipedia's guidelines. The most immediate issue with the current article is that the title is now incorrect. The organization has recently been renamed to """"New Leaders"""" and is now no longer """"New Leaders for New Schools"""". Due to this change, I believe that the article should be renamed.

I recognize that since I prepared my draft on behalf of New Leaders, I have a conflict of interest. So, before I make any changes, I'd like to ask that other editors read through my draft and my explanation here, and offer any feedback they might have. 

There are a number of problems with the current article, not least that it is rather promotional in tone. It seems that this has attracted the attention of editors in the past, as you can see from the warning tag. However, despite the warning tag, and the discussion that was opened by NDSteve10 on the Talk page (see above), there hasn't really been any improvement to the article in the last 12 months. No editors responded to the Talk page note, and only a few edits have been made. In fact, little has changed with the article since it was originally created in December 2009. 

The article currently has few citations, less than half of which are reliable secondary sources. The introduction doesn't adequately summarize the article, and certainly does not give a real sense of what New Leaders does. The most problematic sections are What it does and Educational impact, both of which are written in a promotional tone, especially the latter. In addition, the """"What it does"""" section is outdated, since the organization has since introduced new programs and initiatives. Meanwhile, the """"Educational impact"""" section provides a lot of detail, but would be better presented using Wikipedia's summary style. The information provided is cited to New Leaders' website, but makes no mention that the source of the claims is the organization itself.

I would like to propose a new draft of the article that addresses the issues with the current version, which you can view in my userspace:User:16912 Rhiannon/New Leaders

This is an entirely re-written article, using reliable secondary sources as much as possible, with new section headings to provide readers with a sense of the content at a glance, a new introduction which properly summarizes the article, and an infobox with all the key information about the organization fully up to date. The """"Creation and history"""" section now includes details of the organization's founding and expansion up to the present day. The descriptive information about New Leaders' has been removed, as this is more relevant in the new """"Function"""" section. The information from the current """"What it does"""" and """"Educational impact"""" sections has been rewritten under a new section heading of """"Function"""", which includes the organization's mission, its programs and its results. This section provides details of all the organization's current initiatives and an overview of the impact of these programs. I have retained the sections on """"Geographic reach"""" and """"Executive team"""", but updated the information in each and added citations. 

While I have put much effort into writing this from a neutral POV, I appreciate that due to my COI it may be that other editors have some changes to suggest. I welcome any productive feedback on the draft and my suggestion to rename the article to New Leaders. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or questions. Thanks,   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 I think this is all rather scholastic. The name is admittedly imperfect due to the fact that the article essentially catalogues very recent (by the standards of any encyclopedia) and ongoing events.

And not just some highly localised and geopolitically irrelevant (unless you watch CNN claptrap on a daily basis) squabble somewhere in the Near East. Russia is the only state that not merely defies the US, but challenges the entire status quo as established post-Cold War, as is clear from Putin's quotes cited in the Background section. There is every sign that he is determined to achieve at least what the USSR had, i.e. dominance over half of the Continental Europe, or to go nuclear in a very literal sense of the term, i.e. obliterating the centres of Western civilisation. This is almost official now. Thus, at the end of the day, Yes, it is about the US vs the RF, as the US is the only military force in NATO to speak of.

82f262dbbd9766a7,"I just got out of the hospital. 

I just got out of the hospital after an overnight stay and I really don't need my page deleted. I have far more important issues to deal with than dealing with someone who deletes my page just so they can feel important. If you still need to complain, go to nobody and please just don't complain. Considering that I've worked on 5 Featured Articles and I've completed 3 Featured Lists, I think I know how to make a wiki page. As of April 29, 2008, I have 18066 edits on the English-language Wikipedia. That's a lot.
I have more important things to do with my time than deal with self-appointed wiki-cops. I'm busy pointlessly trying to convince people that their own actions, not anyone else's actions, are what gets them into trouble. Because I will so get them in trouble if thier actions in this fake wiki-land where I am sherriff don't make me happy, fake pretend Wiki-Trouble that is. It's not actual trouble that anyone cares about, just fake pretend wiki-troubles. Wiki-troubles are worse than real troubles in real life. If you get into Wiki-Trouble, the Raincoat Beaver Dragon comes to get you..... 

Thank You.

Hello, Ckatz.  I wonder about consensus when Wikipedia also provides the following guidance: votes are not necessarily binding.  Have I mis-read something?

I actually agree completely with Aïki, but I suspect you don't actually realize what he/she(?) just said.  Aïki really just restated what I had written when I edited the article summary a while back:
In common usage, the term """"inertia"""" is sometimes also used to refer to an object's momentum, or to describe its """"amount of resistance to change"""" (which is technically the same as its mass). It is important to understand that these uses of the term are not the same as Newton's more fundamental description of """"inertia"""" as a principle of the way the universe works (which is not a measurable thing).
In other words, some people sometimes use the term """"inertia"""" to refer to other things than the principle of inertia.  However, the principle of inertia is still an important and valid principle, and is the primary meaning of the term.  In many cases, one needs to use context to determine whether somebody is referring to the principle or to something else, but I think we've pretty well established from the conversation above that we're talking about the principle of inertia here, not the (conventional but inaccurate) other uses of the term.

Mattisse, please believe me that I had no intention of pre-determining the outcome of the GAR.  As I said, I hadn't even read the article with any great attention when I put it up for GAR.  I then read it, and said that in my view it passed.  I could well be wrong: I'm willing to be put right.

In saying that the prose was OK but not great, I was thinking precisely of WP:WIAGA which requires of a Good Article that """"the prose is clear and the spelling and grammar are correct.""""  This is a lesser hurdle than the """"professional"""" quality required of an FA.  To say this is not a criticism of GA.

Now, again, I could well be wrong with my understanding of the current standards at GA.  I have done plenty of GA reviews in my time, but not recently.  This is why I pinged Geometryguy, an uninvolved editor who has great experience with GA, whose views I respect enormously.  More generally, the point of GAR is to seek comments from the broader community.

Again, if I (or anyone else) wanted to ride roughshod over the GA process, we'd simply have reviewed the article and passed it forthwith.  But no: my purpose in putting the article up for GAR was to defuse the conflict, and get a broader spectrum of views.

The purpose was also to separate out the question of the article review from the issue of the block.  At GAR, we're judging the article, not the editor (or even the reviewer).

Apparently, the dispute is over whether the term """"Greek Macedonians"""" should be used to refer to the Greek Macedonians. While it is a sourced term and is in use by academics as has been demonstrated above, there is a strong refusal to including it.

 E pluribus unum = 13 letters 

Symbolically, the phrase E pluribus unum has 13 letters (as does annuit coeptis). This example of gematria (isopsephy) then represents the 13 colonies becoming the United States. The back of the US 2010 penny features E pluribus unum and a shield with 13 vertical stripes. The back of the US dollar includes these 13 letters among 13 symbolic references to the number 13. - p. 121, The Secret Symbols of the Dollar Bill by David Ovason (Harper Collins, 2004)

The ancient practice of Hebrew gematria/Greek isopsephy/Arabic gematria (and modern Simple[6,74] English[7,74] Gematria[8,74]) appears to primarily concentrate on the gematric sums of words/names, i.e. Sargon=74 (S19+a1+r18g7+o15+n14). But this is actually 'Step 2' of gematria(74). 'Step 1' of gematria(8) is simply counting the number of letters in a word/name/phrase. Because of Latin Numerals not coinciding with their place in the Latin Alphabet, i.e. I does not = 1, Latin Gematria never gave much importance to Step 2 of gematric sum. But the learned Romans and other learned practioners of Latin did recognize Step 1 of counting the Latin letters and giving significance to it. This example of counting the number of letters and giving it importance and can be traced back to Plato's use of """"God is ever a geometer"""", which in Greek - equals 3,1,4,1,5,9 or 3.14159 pi. - Brad Watson, Miami, FL 64.136.26.22  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Bacon is widely acknowledged to have had romantic attachments to other males, and is today considered to have had homosexual tastes. Among the many modern authors acknowledging this aspect of his life are A .L. Rowse, A .L. Rowse, Homosexuals in History, New York: Carroll & Garf, 1977. page 44 Rictor Norton, Rictor Norton, """"Sir Francis Bacon"""", The Great Queens of History, updated 8 Jan. 2000 http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/baconfra.htm, Alan Stewart, Jardine, Lisa; Stewart, Alan Hostage To Fortune: The Troubled Life of Francis Bacon Hill & Wang, 1999. page 148, Louis Crompton, Homosexuality and Civilization; pp388-391 and Joseph Cady. Nieves Mathews is among the few modern writers to take an opposing view,Mathews, Nieves Francis Bacon: The History of a Character Assassination, Yale University Press, 1996 claiming that the sources are not conclusive: (1) a quote from the private diary of Simonds D'Ewes (Bacon's enemy in Parliament, but considered to be a responsible and scrupulous lawyer), (2) a quote from Brief Lives by John Aubrey (written after Bacon's passing): he """"was a pederast"""" and """"had ganimeds and favourites"""", (3) and a note by Ann Bacon in which she expressed disapproval of the friends Francis and Anthony were associating with (since one was a """"Papist"""" and money was owned to her sons: """"that bloody Percy [who Bacon kept] as a coach companion and bed companion.""""). Coaches were one of the few private spaces at the time, thus the term """"coach companion"""" is a clear reference to sexual doings.

I am a USPS employee. I am not much of an author, nor am I a WP expert (so this is probably in the wrong place and horridly formatted, feel free to fix it), but there have been a lot of changes since the 'sorting mail' section was written. For one, the MLOCR's have almost been entirely phased out and their function is now done by DIOSS machines, which are similar to DBCS machines but have the ability to perform OCR function, as well as take images and spray ID tags on the back of pieces (for mail with addresses that cannot be read by the OCR software), as well as spray barcodes on the front. Also, the article seems to give no mention of DPS, which is a set of sort programs that take local mail (letters only, although the PO is evaluating machines that will do this with flats) and put it in walking (or driving) order for carriers to deliver. There are also lots of other changes, as well as machinery and equipment about which there probably isnt much public information, including the LCTS, APPS, RCS, FSM-100, and FSM-100-AI. There is also the entire PARS system, which is is quite interesting:

 —Preceding unsigned comment added by 216.46.197.119   

 Sorry not to be of more help, but... 
There's a contradiction between the first section which says the USPS is the third-largest employer and the employment section which claims it's the second-largest.  I don't know which it is, but someone should fix that.

Should be the third largest - behind The Dept of Defense and Walmart.  I have changed that three times - I will NOT do it again.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.3.50.168   

Removal of 'Monopoly' section
While I removed the 'Monopoly' section prior to reading the discussion pages I firmly stand behind its erasure. The word monopoly is not an appropriate word to describe a quasi-government enterprise.  While describing the USPS as a monopoly may be true in the strictest of terms, the context of its usage is clearly biased.  Historically, the term has been used to describe private entities whose capital power has eliminated all useful and healthy competition. Furthermore, the word is charged with political and economic implications inappropriate for an objective article. By extension of the posters logic, the police, fire, military, the ‘Fed’, PBS, NPR, and others are violators of anti-trust laws as well.  While the USPS does not receive funds from public monies, it’s also not – as far as I know – legislated to make a profit.  Making the USPS the first ‘monopoly’ in the history of capitalist economics to ignore profits and losses altogether.
Your understanding of capitalist economics is somewhat incomplete.  Please review anarcho-capitalism, in which the state is viewed as having a monopoly on social services.  

There are no sources that deny that the USPS is a monopoly and numerous sources that say it is. Of course it is. Any good or service that has no competition is by definition a monopoly. The government forbids competition in letter mail by law. Being a monopoly doesn't require that you're violating anti-trust laws. The USPS is what's called a legal monopoly. I'm going to put the section back in.  01:25, 4 Septem",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 i tend to agree with the users who state that you edit unfairly and use personal attacks 

there are so many examples and many different users have posted in her complaining.  perhaps for the benefit of yourself and wikipedia you should have an admin review your actions and recommend alternative methods for you on wikipedia.

its certainly easy to find an argument on wikipedia but it shouldn't be why you come here.  for example in one of your many arguments you state """"There you go again. You see, Smee, what you just did is called passive-aggressive behavior. You're being condescending, superior, haughty, hypocritical and insulting, yet you're couching it in just the right language to still be able to say you're being """"polite"""". I have merely criticized your edits and here you are still lashing out many hours later and criticizing my lack of """"tact"""" in doing so. I felt really bad about upsetting you before, Smee, but the more you talk like this, the less bad I feel now. Keep talkin'.""""

it seems like not only do you behave in a way that offends people.. but that you then enjoy the arguments that inevitably follow.  Did something in your current life/childhood happen that left you profoundly angry at the world?  Because that is how it looks when you talk like that.  

There simply wouldnt be so many arguments and traded insults in your talk page if you didn't have some sort of long simmering anger eating away at you.  I don't think wikipedia is the venue for dealing with it 

i am not trying to be condescending or insulting.. i hope not to offend you.. but for the sake of other's feelings (who you seem to go out of your way to offend) and the quality of articles you should attempt to compromise more instead of turning red.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Placenames in Kosovo

Please, before making or discussing changes to the names used in all Kosovo-related topics, review carefully our general naming conventions and the specific ones on geographic names, using English & settlements.

In short, they ask us to reflect common English usage (which will often will be a local name, or one of them; but not always), because those are the forms our intended readership of English speakers would most easily recognize.

For a number of historical reasons, the English language has adopted the Serbian forms. We merely restrict ourselves to reflect this usage. Wikipedia is not a venue to advocate the adoption of the Albanian names by the English language.

Hello Attilios! First, thanks for your appreciative comments! I certainly plan to complete and bring the rest of the Isaurian period article to the same level, and then probably do the Amorian period too, for they are perhaps the most under-appreciated periods in the Empire's history. The other periods also need lots of work of course, but it will be some time before I will be able to do anything about that. I've got a couple of dozen ongoing projects or other articles I want to do, so time is short. Any help you can offer will, of course, be appreciated, be it pointing out an unclear sentence or a mistake, or adding some important point you feel I overlooked. Just be bold and edit. Since Byzantium is an area where only a handful of editors are active, IMO, if you can go ahead and write up even a sketchy, rudimentary outline on some of these topics (e.g. the horribly short Byzantium under the Justinian dynasty), you'd be helping a great deal. And if you can bring some respectable Italian sources in, that'd be a further bonus.

For the map, it has some problems, and I have been revising it for some time now, although the present status is still nowhere near good enough for it to be uploaded. For Naples and Gaeta, both cities are usually listed as acknowledging at least nominal Byzantine suzerainty at the time, their rulers accepting Byzantine titles etc. Now I admit that Byzantine Italy is not my field of expertise, so if you have some good sources to show otherwise, I'll change that too.

Forgot to mention another thing; the main image on the points of sail would be  Image:Points of sail for single sail, double masted sailboats .I recently went over the sailing for dummies book again and here, 2 masts with sails are shown for the schematic, this is more accurate (most common sailboats have only but 1 mast but 2 sails which work like a 2 masted sailboat with 1 sail per mast. In a schematic it is best to simply draw 2 masts with 1 sail. The reason why this is done (besides being just more accurate) is also because it makes a noticable difference at 180° to the wind (running); here sails are placed """"goosewinged"""", so the efficiency and method is similar to a square rigged ship at this coarse. With a image you have now (1 sail, 1 mast) this isn't possible and so the image if faulty in a way. This is btw also the reason why I myself got a little confused at first on this. I mentioned before that you could make a square rigged sailboat points of sail; with this suggestion this would not be so required; instead you could best make this image first and not bother about the other image any time soon.

 Years 1900 to 1961 done 

Reply to User_talk:Grey_Shadow#Years_1900_to_1961_done.

I lost count above 1000 

 I was waiting on your comments. 

Feel free to publish at any time. I will move what is in the incomplete list to the novels stubs. I am glad you like the format. I will continue to add more, but that will do for now. I will put the new list up today so it does what the page says. Sorry for the delay, I was waiting on your comment. Eagle talk 
yes please feel free to modify my statement. (publish all the plans. I would like to have more imput) Eagle talk 

 Novels and Movies 

For articles that cover both a novel and a movie of the same title, is there a standard article title format to split them up (e.g. """"Starship Trropers (novel)"""", """"Starship Troopers (movie)"""")? Also, is there a standard novel infobox to be used at this time?

Second things first. Non specifically, but we use {t1|Infobox Book}}. On the naming the major work of the two would tend to get the """"basic title"""" and the other would tend to get either """"Title (novel)"""" or """"Title (film)"""" or if more than one """"Title (Jo Soap novel)"""" or """"Title (1992 film)"""". Hope that helps. Don't forget Disambiguation pages. :   (Talk Page)/ 

And thanks for the heads up regarding archives. Seems a much better way to clean up.  

no problem. :   (Talk Page)/ 

 Criteria 

Criteria is as you set it. I will move the book to novel stuff to the right place. within 26 hours of this post I will put up the new prototype list. Status of the code is go ). 
Note on the criteria, for the current lists it is as stated. For the new proto list (up in 26 hours of this post) it will be very simple, are the hits correct, am I giving you guys articles that have complete infoboxes? I can guarrentee that all the articles will have an infobox... becuase I will be parsing the template category. The primary problem will be to seperate out novels from the books. (right now the code will give both) Remember this is a wiki... All I am doing is writing the code, this wikiproject needs to tell me what to do. (p.s. I want to start to have conversations on one of our forums (WP:NOVEL talk page), rather than on our talk pages. Eagle talk 
To make it 100% clear, the new proto list will have ALL the incomplete infoboxes. Our problem will be sorting the novels from the books. (of course we could do both..., or make this list a joint project...) Eagle talk 

ok by 04:00, 7 july 2006 (UTC) I will be ready. Feel free to edit my statement in the newsletter ) I have other things on my hand. Thanks Eagle talk

 Urartu case 

First of all, I would like to complain about spying and stalking on all my activities from users like Nareklm. The latter recently interfered in page """"Request of Assistance"""" and removed a reference to personal attack which I reported to PAIN. I realize that my link is not valid anymore since it was archived. But case was reported - I have been insulted by Eupator.

Now - about Urartu.

First - I made my references. Those users  have been removed references. Wikipedia has a quite strong guidance about that. Further - about relevancy of my text, actually not only mine - there is other users who supported me)

I argue that section of """"Ethnic Composition"""" in page Urartu and page """"Antiquity"""" in page Armenia in its current version imply ethnic continuity and strong bonds between people who lived in Urartu (Academicians for example use term 'people of Urartu') and Armenians, who (sources I quoted say) moved in Urartu in 7-6 BC. My argument is not only about language diferrences. It is about ethnic and cultural ones. My arguments are on 'Request of Assistance' page. 

I'd like to quote professional historian about Urartu-Armenia nexus:

Philip L. Kohl, Clare Fawcett. Nationalism, Politics and the Practice of Archaeology (New Directions in Archaeology). Page 157: """"No less problematic are heavily slanted interpretations of the Urartian kingdom, the first historically attested state in Transcaucasia (ninth to seventh centuries BC). Armenian chauvinists must explain why this state, a worthy adversary of the neo-Assyrian Empire of northern Mesopotamia and one that expanded over much of """"historic Armenia,"""" composed its royal cuneiform inscriptions in Urartian, a non Indo-European ( i.e., non-Armenian) language, related to Hurrian and ancestral to the Northeastern Caucasian family of languages spoken today by different peoples in Daghestan, Chechenia, and Ingushetia (see Jankowska 1991:231). Reasonable historical hypotheses can be advanced for a Proto-Armenian component to this kingdom, and there is a real sense in which the Armenians are the cultural heirs of Urartu, but an essentialist view of Armenian culture which equates it precisely with the Urartian kingdom cannot be sustained. One must distinguish between popular and professional Armenian interpretations of Urartu, the latter being subtler and more difficult to evaluate. Thus, popular reference to the """"Piotrovskii problem"""" is based on the fact that B.B. Piotrovskii, the late Director of the Hermitage in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and former head of the excavations at Karmir Blur (the ancient Urartian capital of Teishebaine now located within the city of Yerevan), had quite reasonably maintained that the mighty Urartian Iron Age kingdom did not constitute the first Armenian state for the reasons stated above; the """"problem"""" only existed for those who wanted Armenians always to have lived in and controlled """"historic Armenia"""" until the later ravages wrought by Romans, Persians, Arabs, and Turks. More discriminating professional archaeologists, who may accept the reasonable theory that the ethnogenesis or formation of Armenian culture occurred during post-Urartian Achaemenid times, extol the might of the Urartians and see them exercising political control over most of eastern Anatolia, western Iran, and Transcaucasia; in this respect they remain the direct precursors of the Armenian kingdom under Tigran II.""""  

Finally, the problem is not only in the content of dispute itself. It is also about behavior of users - their insults, reluctuance to accomodate various views. """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

October to November, 1868 (Custerwest)

The battle (Custerwest)
Swap with our Battle section, based on the modern official account. Custerwest's contains the things which didn't happen, such as the discredited story of """"4 to 6 white captives"""" (discussed in detail before). I also noticed the version by Custerwest completely ommits civilian casalties (except the chief's wife).

Swap with ours - based only on the indiscussable things confirmed now, including what Custer said (which would be or not be true, but is not used in the today's estimates). Also, as always, only the government websites (AMH and Washita site). Also, I think it's more informative, and as the rest better written even (his is a mess).  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

1. Inline citations are not required by policy

No policy requires inline citations. They are often a good idea, and are a requirement for feature article status, but it is not a requirement for all articles. Furthermore, the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources. This tag therefore enshrines a particular editor's view about style (that the article in question should have inline citations) in an inappropriate way. That point belongs on the talk page, not in the article itself. Robert A.West (Talk) 

    Where does it say that featured articles have different requirements then other articles? Jeepday 

        The whole point in to get citations for all articles so that they meet the WP:V requirements, I have noticed that tags quite often help by bringing this to attention of users, particularly new-ish users. Cheers SeanMack 

            I agree with Jeepday and SeanMack. Our ultimate goal should be for every article to be of FA quality.  Satori Son 

                That goal is not consensus among editors. But more importantly, inline citations for every fact are not an FA requirement; see WP:FA? section 1c. CMummert · talk

The Bakersfield Californian ^ | Feb 21 2007 | LEONEL MARTINEZ My catechism teacher, Sister Mary Lou Petrillo, was a smart and scrappy nun who drilled into us the basics of Catholicism without demeaning other Christian churches or religions. Too bad Sister Mary Lou isn't available to teach a few intensive lessons on tolerance to the campaign people of presidential candidate John Edwards. Within the last few weeks, two bloggers for the former North Carolina senator resigned after being hit with criticism from conservative Catholic organizations angered by past anti-Catholic remarks the bloggers posted on the Web, according to CNN. Melissa McEwan and Amanda Marcotte quit after groups like the Catholic...

 Hi Peter, I'll look into this bug shortly. I will run a trace of your classifications and see if, indeed, some of the revisions do show up twice. This is pretty core functionality for something to go wrong and unnoticed for so long  although maybe it is specific to the WikiTrust queue  which does not see a lot of use. This is the user-name you were using? And you logged in with the same user-name both times, right?
 Can you describe what the scrolling issue is? I fret this could be a tougher fix  its not like I actually implement scrolling, this is just something Java provides. 
 Also, you'll generally find that the accuracy of classifications among the queues looks like """"Cluebot-NG > STiki > WikiTrust"""" (assuming everything is working correctly). This is of course, is dependent on a complex set of criteria, how many people have been using a particular queue lately, etc.

Fair use rationale for Image:BoxartforACAC.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:BoxartforACAC.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

3d968ec4d3c739bf,"Anarchism versus Religion 

Anarchism what does it mean for this anarchist hobbyist?

Anarchism started the First World War over the anarchist assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.  A anarchist decided to interrupt a world power practicing imperialism and assassinated the Archduke as he drove by the anarchist in the tiny nation of Serbia.  What the anarchist did not know is that there were a multitude of secret treaties among no less that fourteen nations including attitude from the Ottoman Empire and within weeks the world was at war as Serbia was invaded.

The result of the war that started in the tiny nation of Serbia is millions of deaths, chemical warfare, proof of machine gun and artillery fire, introduction of aviation into warfare, the Russian communist revolution, and a new world order that led to World War Two, since the Germans believed it was their leaders who failed them causing them to lose the war.

World War Two led to millions of deaths and a larger battlefield across the world including China and the Pacific Ocean (Japan was part of World War One, but the results were insignificant compared to the bloody battlefields of Europe).  The results of World War Two led to nuclear weapons, a space race, spy satellites, nuclear ships, nuclear bombers, nuclear missiles, communism across the world from communist Russia, United States being called imperialist due to being a world wide undefeated military power who is unafraid to invade anyone except the nations with the largest and best militaries (Iraq had a lager but sad capability military).  World War Two also led to the Cold War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Desert Storm One that was the result of the former allies of World War Two dividing among themselves into two parties and fighting low intensity and hot wars across the world until the year 1991 including, for many families, three or more generations of military service from the United States.

Serbia as a result of the wars across the world of the 20th century has been subjected to the Muslims, Russians, United States, Germans, and civil war within itself and still has United States intervention this 21st century.  Under President Clinton Serbia was made smaller requiring a split of Kosovo and Serbia after a long bombing campaign that exhausted the stockpile of conventional United States missiles during the 1990s.

Serbia got its anarchy and is a backwards nation that has been under subjugation and gunfire since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Embrace anarchy and declare Heaven non-religion in a discussion section where Heaven is something of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faith where the other faiths are atheistic in nature and worship man by a code of conduct, then you should embrace anarchy and go live off the lands in a mountain.  You have little knowledge of mythology and I bet you have no idea what you are doing concerning religion other than your personal attitude.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Relax guys. I'm sorry you thought it was rude; that's not what I was going for. I can be a poor judge of what will or won't be controversial. Just remember if you don't like it it's as simple as undoing it.

Now, Alec2011 says that I don't understand what the page is for. I'm sorry, there isn't anything that gives a specific """"mission statement"""" for the article anywhere. So can you tell me? Just going on my own, I figured that if people want to know which songs are on which albums, they would just go to the album articles themselves. So having them organized that way seemed redundant to me. It seems that the only point to having an article like this is to show where the songs appear in the series. Because there is so much overlap between where they appear in the series and where they appear in the albums I did it this way.

And if your main complaint is that it's harder to edit because the list is too long, then we could always divide it by season. So there, I've opened a discussion. Be nice please.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Hitler was quite right when he said that Admiral Graf Spee should have won the battle. She lost because of errors made by captain Langsdorff. Graf Spee outgunned all her opponents, having 11 inch main guns, to Exeters 8 inch and Ajax and Achilles 6 inch guns.

Langsdorff should have concentrated the fire on Exeter first before Admiral Graf Spee came into the range of the light cruisers.

Instead, Langsdorff split his fire between the three targets, with the result that although Exeter was severely damaged and forced to withdraw, the other ships got into range and scored 20 hits on Admiral Graf Spee, including on the food stores and bakeries.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Hi Tony, as far as I know, once you are a user in one Wikipedia, somehow you become a user in all/most of the others (including for example, Commons). I may be wrong in this, however I don't remember having created a user id and password in the Spanish Wikipedia yet I have an account there.

In any event, part of the “secret” has something to do with something called “unified logins” and you can find which wikipedias you are “attached” to by going to >>>>  My Preferences > Basic Information > Global Account status > Manage your global account

I don’t know how it decides which wikis to attach you to and which ones not (for example, I am not attached to Wikitravel), but what the heck? it works for the Spanish, English, and Commons which is where I spend 99% of my wiki time.

I have been editing the Spanish Wikipedia and will probably do so even more in the future: it allows me to reach the other 50% of Puerto Ricans that don’t read English fluently. (Check out my article in teh Spanish wiki for Millito Navarro – I started by translating it from the English Wiki and now the Spanish version is not only more complete than the English counterpart, but also has 3x the references, is more current and, probably most importantly, it has an accurracy that can be backed up 100%. You know, I can't be contect with incomplete articles if the rest of teh info is readily available.) 

I will be more than happy to fulfill you request for the move; and have already sone so.  I had read negative comments about the Spanish Wikipedia related to how much more problematic it was to edit, how editors there didn’t know what they where doing, and how there seem to be not a fully developed system for dealing with conflicts etc. Some (a little?) of that may be true; the rest may be perception only. I am learning the ropes there and stay out of trouble by creating/editing article most people don’t care about for now (read: Ponce – haha), but once interest develops I know I have the truth well “under my belt” to deal with the sporadic drive-by editor that wants to make changes based on unacceptable motives (personal, political, etc – you know what I am talking about) rather than verifiable truth.   

Also, its very easy to jump (to appear logged in and all) from one wiki to the other: just take an article in the English wiki which you know also exists in Spanish wiki and hit the link on the left that says “Spanish” and bingo!!!! you are there! I use “Cerro de Punta” because it exists in both wikis AND because it is short and, thus, I don’t have to scroll down to see the “Spanish” link.

I found an Associated Press report from after World War I that states that Bethmann-Hollweg was partly of Jewish extraction.  I added this to the personal information about Bethmann-Hollweg, along with a link to a PDF of the article in the New York Times.  All I said was that according to this article, he was of Jewish extraction. That is a demonstrably, undeniably true statement!  It definitely was stated in an AP report that appeared in the New York Times that Bethmann-Hollweg was of Jewish descent.  Why then would somebody keep removing this reference?  GoodMorningWorld has done this several times. He claims that it is CERTAINLY not true, but IT IS CERTAIN that the AP said it and that it appears in the New York Times.  If GoodMorningWorld has some argument that the claim in the AP story was wrong then he should post it in the text of the article along with the claim.  Otherwise he appears to be trying to censor information that he finds disagreeable. Who the hell does he think he is?  
I explained to you why including this information in the article is inappropriate, on your Talk page on July 2: """"It doesn't matter what some foreign correspondent for the NYT mistakenly wrote 90 years ago if we know with certainty that it is false. The only reason to include it in the encyclopedia would be if the false report had turned into an incident in its own right. In that case, some brief mention might be warranted. Otherwise, no."""" Wikipedia is not an indiscrimate collection of information.   

You haven't explained anything that matters.  You assert that the information is false, despite the eminence of the source, and the information is to be suppressed based on nothing more than your say-so.  Why you believe that it is false is your own secret; it is clear only that you do not want to allow it to be discussed. I do not think that this kind of dogmatism and censoriousness represent an appropriate attitude for someone contributing to an encyclopaedia. 

Since there is a section of the article that discusses Bethmann-Hollweg's ethnic heritage, I think it is clearly relevant that he was identified by the Associated Press and the New York Times in his own lifetime as a person of Jewish descent. The Associated Press and the New York Times are normally considered credible journalistic sources, so that the burden of proof rests on you to show that what was reported was false. If you really know what you pretend to know, that Bethmann-Hollweg was not a person of Jewish descent, then prove it.   
I'm growing really tired of Hadding's belligerent, know-nothing approach to encyclopedic articles. Wikipedia isn't some game where you fire up Google, find a hit, then carry that snippet back here and wedge it into an article, without knowing anything at all about the article subject and therefore being in no position to evaluate its accuracy. I am reverting Hadding's repeated insertion of false information. Hadding, consider this your only warning. If you continue this destructive and harmful approach I will report you to an admin noticeboard. Alternatively – if you want to demonstrate a sincere interest – then learn German and read this passage in a book by historian Fritz Fischer, which speaks of B.-H.'s parentage. Or just read the goddamn Wikipedia article which already contains that information.   

That is not a """"passage"""" about """"Bethmann-Hollweg's parentage.""""  That is a chapter about Bethmann-Hollweg as chancellor, from a book about Hitler. I do not believe that the claim from the Associated Press and New York Times about Bethmann-Hollweg's Jewish ethnic heritage is addressed whatsoever in that book.  

If there is a sentence in that book that you think makes your case then why don't you cite it?  

I hope that you do call in the administrators, because I would like to call attention to a certain paranoid mind that believes that there is some conspiracy spanning the entire internet with the purpose of misrepresenting certain people as Jews. To wit, from the history page of the Bethmann-Hollweg entry:

Easy enough,
Semi-randomly; when I sit down to do some editing, my starting point is always one of 3 places: Monitoring new page creation (New Page Patrol), monitoring recent changes or existing items on my watch list (items accumulated from the above 2). Any article I tag for deletion was either originated from #1 or #2 above, or was linked to in one of the above.
Generally I don't discriminate; if I see 3 very similar articles worthy of deletion or at least a deletion discussion (AfD), all 3 will be up for a nomination. I qualify that with """"generally"""" because I don't always have the time/energy/desire/etc to do all that work. In that case I'll add the others to a """"to do"""" list or my watch list. However, if 1 or 2 of those 3 articles are better off (e.g. topics that are clearly notable, but no one's taken the time to dig up sources, or the article already has better sources), I'll use the appropriate cleanup tag (ones that indicate the article needs additional sources). It always comes down to the quality of the sources; a single mention in a nationally published news source (e.g. NY Times) carries a lot more weight than scattered blog postings or trivial mentions.

In other words, people in prehistoric societies have no particualar commonalities except a lack of writing.  Prehistory is a rubric used by scholars to differentiate the methods used to study the past, not a type of people.  There is no such thing as a stage of personhood or social development in which a person is a prehistoric man or woman.  For example, the Inca remained a prehistoric people until the Spanish conquest and yet they ruled one of the most impressive empires on earth and still had no writen records (quipa were memory aids, not writing).  In Central America, the prehistoric period starts more than a thousand years earlier.

Speedy deletion of Kaleb Young
 A tag has been placed on Kaleb Young requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

 Terms not concepts 
I think at some point I saw in my watchlist a comment from someone about some kind of term not being a concept. I was puzzled at the time, and now today you have reverted the inclusion of a terms category in a concepts category. (I am wondering if that was you not too long ago). I am also wondering if you have some special knowledge, perhaps based in some study of philosophy of language or metaphysics, or if this is your general impression? I'm in a pretty embarrassing spot here, as pretty clearly any term is also a concept (this is not intended to count for physical objects which can also be """"thought of""""). The only question is about organizing the subject matter according to some ontology that makes sense. There are many """"terminology"""" categories, and I basically see them as """"junk"""" categories where articles that are hard to classify end up. I can't be everywhere, but in the areas I take care of, I dutifully remove articles from """"terminology"""" categories and place them in the appropriate subcategory of """"concepts"""".

Well from the offerings you have made on your wiki, blog and elsewhere, you would certainly be a gem of an editor here. Your comments on the 10 commandments to save world fisheries and your notion of a Pacific Islands Fisheries Management Index move in directions I think the Wikipedia articles should. It's true that Wikipedia is more anonymous and constrains, in that you cannot present original research, but must instead back up statements with verifiable sources. It is an encyclopedia, so the encyclopediac game must be played. But still, that doesn't have to be that constraining, and Wikipedia has many advantages. The demand to be encyclopediac can often help cut through bull shit and starkly clarify where new research is needed. Important current issues that cannot be adequately sourced can still be discussed in the talk pages, and strategies can be developed so they may eventually get appropriate external sources. Well structured articles will be here to stay. They can have modest starts, but if properly framed will lend themselves to incremental improvements over time. Your articles need not drop off the edge of the blogosphere or disappear into the limbo of deceased wikis. They will have far more traffic and outreach than blogs or personal wikis can ever have. The traffic should increase with time. And of course you can still personally invite collaborators. An article on Pacific Islands Fisheries could be set up as a start to your index project, and a very nice article it could be too. We could work it up to FA. I think """"commandments"""" for sustainable fisheries is probably the single most important topic in the Fisheries and Fishing WikiProject, and I'm sure we could eventually get that humming nicely in attention grabbing but encyclopediac ways across a number of articles.

If you look at Wikipedia Bosanski only latin is used (Whether it be fr pratical reasons or not). This does go along with my point that latin is used (MOSTLY, Almost always). If cyrillic was really official like it is in Serbia, then the Bosnian Wikipedia would be both in cyrillic and latin (like the Serbian Wikipedia it is in both). The Bosnian Wikipedia says that it uses the latin script for pratical reasons (such as: people do not have the cyrillic keyboard, etc.) Well this goes along with my point that it is not used as much. People do not have cyrillic keyboards like the people in Serbia.

Offical newspapers in Bosnia are not in cyrillic. They are in latin. (Slobodna Bosna, Oslobodjenje, Ljiljan, Nezavisne Novine (For all ethnicities), neither are their websites. Cyrillic is most commonly used in Serbia.

How are you going to use a Wikipedia Article to prove your point. Now where does it say that it is 100% correct. I had problems with the German Wikipedia on Bosanska Dubica, they claimed that Hrvatska Dubica and Bosanska Dubica were the same town/municipality. This is just crazy. Anyways I will never understand why people, who have no clue about where Dubica is or have never before heard about the town, write about it. My point is that people can write things on a biased level. They showed me websites as proof, but websites cannot be used as refrences in the United States for grammar school projects. Websites can never be trusted.

I mentioned this before, www.google.ba uses Bosnian and Croatian in latin, but if you want to search google.ba in cyrillic then you have to click Serbian to search google.ba in cyrillic.

I also looked at several different translation websites and found that if you want to translate into Bosnian, then you are translating into latin (Bosnian). However, for Serbian it gives you an option (latin or cyrillic).

In the world Bosnian is viewed by Bosnians and by the rest of the world as using the latin script.

Then explain to me why the Serbian template does not have latin and cyrillic. 

I would have to say that only Srpsko-Hrvatski should have both, but the languages that have split from Yugoslavia, should be chosen by its users. If you want to changed the Bosnian template than use it. Please do not change something you do not feel represented by.

The country of Bosnia and Herzegovina recognizes the three languages: Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian. Serbian is the one that uses cyrillic and that is how it is offical in Bosnia. The Bosnian language does not tend to use cyrillic",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Your talent at invoking """"personal attack"""" seems to exceed your talent at replying intelligently to any of my points.

If you can't take the heat, you shouldn't be editing an encyclopedia.  It's pretty clear that Wikipedia's """"personal attack"""" policy is simply a ploy to ban people with whom the administrators disagree, and prevent them from making contributions to Wikipedia, while at the same time preserving the illusion of some level playing field for intellectual discourse.  

To illustrate this point, we need look no further than the items removed by Jimbo from the Justin Berry talk page, citing """"personal attack"""", which included every mention of the term """"camwhore,"""" which is itself a Wikipedia topic, and the following paragraph.  Please feel free to try and figure out who is the victim of the """"personal attack"""" here.

""""I'm dissapointed that the majority of this page was deleted, most likely because one of the editors is a self-admitted pedophile. Is it fair to declare that a pedophile can't be neutral on a page that involves pedophilia?. I guarantee that wikipedia wouldn't ban a Jew from editing a page on the holocaust, or ban a black person from editing a page on affirmative action. A pedophile is just as capable of editing with a neutral POV on a subject matter dealing with pedophilia, as a Jew or a black would be on an issue that involves Jews or blacks. Wikipedia claims to be a online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. If that doesn't include pedophiles, than how is that fair?. If we allow certain sexual minorities to be silenced, what's next?, allowing certain racial minorities to be silenced as well. As a frequent reader and occasional editor of wikipedia, I only want to read factual, neutral POV articles, and I don't care about the race, nationality, ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation of the editor. Even if most people have moral objections to pedophilia, surely we can agree that we all have a right to post on wikipedia as long as we abide by the rules.""""  TAB

The topic of mutual intelligibility in Slavic languages is a bit difficult. For example, Bulgarian is routinely regarded as a language most distant from the Slavic type and very difficult to understand for most Slavs. In Czech, there even exists a saying """"speaking like a Bulgarian"""" for unintelligible speech. Yet the difficulties in understanding lie mainly in grammar (the non-existence of word-endings, the use of articles). You can listen to a Bulgarian, not to understand a word and doubt, if you are actually listening to an Indo-European language - and then you see a Bulgarian text and you are surprised that you can read it quite with ease. So the difference in understanding spoken language and written language can be huge. 
As for the difference between Czech/Slovak and Polish, I must agree with the Polish contributor above that a fluent conversation is not possible. Yet you can certainly understand a lot and conduct some conversation, if you try to be patient. So """"a limited intelligibility"""" would be a more correct term. As for written Polish, Czechs and Slovaks shouldn't have any difficulties with a general understanding Polish text, although quite a few words (especially of technical sort) may seem obscure and untintelligible. However, the closest Slavic language to Czech (after Slovak) is Lusitan Sorbian, especially Upper Sorbian. I don't have any personal experience with this language, but from the written texts I saw I think that its resemblance to Czech can be compared to East Slovakian dialects (which means that you can understand some passages easily, but subsequently you can be lost due to accumulation of weirdly sounding words.)

 My opinions about PRT reflect the position of mainstream transit advocates in Minnesota such as the Sierra Club North Star Chapter .

Any comparisons between PRT and other proven modes of transport is meaningless, unless the purpose  is to mislead.

Cruft in trivia section
A backstage segment featuring dancing is certainly fancruft that doesn't belong. It being a reunion of sorts (and it being at WM) doesn't make it any more notable at all. The dance segment didn't affect any of the matches and certainly doesn't help the article.  
I suggest moving to the notes section.   3:16 
It's always been in the notes section, that's not the problem here. The problem is: it's a backstage segment. Backstage segments aren't notable, and don't affect the matches or anything... why add this one over others? Just because it was a reunion isn't a good enough reason in my opinion. People certainly could argue the Boogey Man/Trump segment was notable, as it featured the first time the 2 had interaction (or just on the fact Trump appeared). It's fancruft and serves no purpose except that some people might think it's """"interesting"""". That's not enough to keep it on the article.  
Oh I didn't see that. Hmmm... let me see what I can do with it...   3:16 

I think that we should just add them to the other talent section if they aren't there already and not mention the dance. It was pretty pointless, and doesn't seem necessary. Peace,  The rid 
While I agree that the Boogeyman segment wasn't notable, this segment had the return of Slick (first time in like 15 years) and a bunch of other WWE legends. It being a reunion and at WM does help its case IMO (especially the reunion part). You are saying being a backstage segment is the problem, so you wouldn't be objecting if they had done this on the stage or in the ring? If we mentioned them in the on screen talent section, what would we put down for them so someone else doesn't remove it. It also got covered in most reviews and coverage of the event (coevering the notability part). Being cruft is an opinion; being a reunion featuring over a dozen legends and covered by almost every review makes it worth at least mentioning.  

Eh, the return of Slick is pretty important. I'll change my vote to Weak Support, as I had forgotten about that point. Peace,  The rid 
Covered in almost every review? I find that very hard to believe. Provide some proof. Also: so what if it's covered? The matches are reviewed in the reviews as well: that doesn't mean we will start listing highlights for each match. I also recall there being a guideline on Wikipedia about it not being a democracy: meaning not everything should be determined by a vote. I somehow think if this fancruft was gone: no one would be re-adding except for TJ. From the edit history: it seems like he was the only one re-adding it back.

As far as I know it has been stated that several """"universes"""" do not fit into the actual accepted universe of Wold Newton which integrates with the DC comics universe thanks to Alan Moore. Thus Marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross-over connections or with the exception of Steven Rogers and Peter Parker whose worlds do not clash with the DC Universe chronology. As for Star Wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the Wold Newton Universe, only Star Wars takes place in an entirely different future-past element, basically a universe that predates that of the Earth. And Tolkien's universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm, the same applies to Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft and Warhammer. However the world of faeries is related thanks to King Arthur and Shakespeare as well as C.S. Lewis and Hans Christian Anderson/Brothers Grimm. Harry Potter's world also doesn't tie in to the Wold Newton as far as I have seen. And as for Looney Tunes and Disney the only way they might tie-in is through WHo Framed Roger Rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. Of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn't, the only reason I added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those """"universes"""" or """"worlds"""" were not present. Perhaps it could be stated that although they are not """"accepted"""" within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole.

Milo opposed the Dayton Accords which he criticized as being anti-Serb

               Dr.I.K.Gill
       He has devoted his life for the needy
Not long ago Dr.I.K.Gill an expert in psychology and physical education came over to Pakistan from Germany. He held workshops in special education and physical education. Under the leadership of Dr.Gill workshops were held in Karachi as well as in Lahore. In Karachi workshops, teachers from special education institutes attended under his able leadership. Teachers from Punjab and North Frontier Province attended the similar courses in Lahore.
Dr.I.K.Gill taught mental health and physical education for handicapped children. During these workshops he instructed the teachers how to teach children in physical movements so that they are able to lead their lives as normal human beings and they do not remain dependant on others.
Dr.I.K.Gill originally comes from Pakistan. He was born 1924 in a village in Sialkot District. He was born in a poor home therefore he had to labour hard in the fields. However, he was keenly interested in acquiring education. He did his primary schooling in his own village and did his high school graduation at C.T.I. High School, Sialkot. After high school he joined the army and served his country in British India Government.  After release from the army he worked in Government College of Physical Education, Walton. Lahore as a superintendent and teacher.
In 1956 he got a chance to go for higher studies in Germany in a college of physical education along with the university of  Cologne, Germany. After graduation from Germany, he went to the University of Graz, Austria for Ph.D. Having completed his PhD he went back to Germany and worked as a teacher of physical education. During his service he happened to see a photo in a church magazine, which alerted his life profoundly for ever. They were the images of people suffering from leprosy. The moment he saw a fellow countryman, he was shaken through and through. At that moment he decided to go to Pakistan. Within a short time by the Grace of God through the German Leprosy Relief Association he landed in Pakistan with his newly wedded wife.
He started his work in Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre in Karachi (e.g.the Leprosy Colony in a hut behind McLeod Road, later a building was bought in Frere Road in Saddar Bazaar)
From 1962 to 1970 Dr, Gill worked for the welfare of Leprosy patients in Pakistan. 
Dr. Gill said about his mission “I always wanted to know those unfortunate people who are dependant in one way or the other upon others. My ambition was to teach such people to be able to do their own work and lead an independent happy life. Such unfortunate people are victim of unhappiness and misery, therefore my yearning was to help and work for the welfare of such weaker sections of community. So I thought I must involve myself in a difficult mission. For such vital mission I chose to come to my own beloved country Pakistan”. Dr. Gill concentrated his special attention  on backward and handicapped children in Pakistan because  in his opinion today’s child is a responsible citizen, a child is tomorrow`s father being the builder and protector of the next generation. Therefore to educate him or her today is very important. Dr. Gill said that besides food and refuge is necessary for these children but undoubted education most important.  Dr. Gill revealed that he is very surprised to discover that parents of these unfortunate children have no ambition to educate these disadvantaged children. Today children are expected to contribute in the family income and expenditure. Let’s say that handicapped children cannot do so, but if they educated to look after their needs themselves and their person, they do not remain dependant upon others for the whole of their lives. Special education can make life easier and productive.
TABIn view of his services from 1962 -70 Government of Pakistan invited Dr.I.K.Gill to Pakistan. He came back to train teachers of physical and special education, so that these teachers could provide special education to needy children in their respective areas. 
Dr. Gill provided this facility in Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi. He stayed and carried on his services for about eight weeks to complete series of lectures.
He also came back this year again to carry on series of special education training which took place in Lahore and Karachi. He appreciated greatly that three universities accepted the challenge and established the departments of special education. Dr. Gill trained forty teachers both in Lahore and Karachi who would further train teachers in special education. Therefore the number of teachers will be increased.

Comment about JJ Bulten

Greetings,

I would like to mention that I added 0% of the """"OR"""" tags and thus am innocent. I realize that when someone is trying to find a compromise, it is easier to blame """"both sides"""" for a conflict. However, on closer inspection, I would be willing to bet that a judge or jury would find that I am arguing on the merits of the Wiki-policies and outside sources, while JJB is using scorched-Earth tactics. Please consider this example:

    The evidence does not favor backing off from requesting a move, for compliance's sake, in some other polite way. First, the """"vote"""" remains 6-4 by my count: no consensus. Second, your unsourced statement of thousands of """"longevity myths"""" cites is probably a Google exaggeration based on estimated mirrors; see above where I sourced the real numbers as 92 vs. 91. Third, this exaggeration only reflects the fact that a vast number of """"myth"""" mirrors stem from Ryoung's wholly unsourced 2005 insertions. (The User:Shii/Hoaxes page normally considers this as evidence of hoaxing. See User talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity, ticklish situation for 26 phrases originating from Ryoung that have exactly zero Google support outside his 2005 insertions.)

            Yet another FALSE accusation. There is no """"hoaxing"""" here at all, nor has there been any attempt at """"hoaxing."""" I am not responsible for third-party sites, but if they choose to copy my work, might it be because they consider it a reliable source?Ryoung122 

                Comment: Looking closer, we see that it was JJB that listed this as a """"hoax"""":

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity.2C_ticklish_situation

Citation of one's own accusation is a circular argument, and thus invalid.

In other words, JJBulten first adds material to Shi's page then cites his own add as """"proof"""" of hoaxing. Actually, it's only proof of his fanaticism, of hitting 'below the belt' in an attempt to radically remake this page in his own image. """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

ae7e01fa4c952931,""":::: sprot only blocks IP (and brand new) addresses from editing - it does not stop anyone from reading, nor does it stop anyone who wants to contribute to create an account with an unidentifiable and untraceable name (i.e., don't give your email address) and contribute.  The edits made by multiple IP addresses on this page, as you know,  have been (not always but  by and large) at best unhelpful but much more often downright offensive and I see absolutely no reason why that should be allowed to continue.  Again, you know I am not talking about the juvenile HI MOMs - they are also annoying, but that is not what plagues this page.  We are plagued by targeted vandalism - changing """"Obama"""" to """"Osama"""", for example, and the regular changing of text that has hidden text clearly requesting that it not be changed right there, plus blatant POV pushing, trolling, etc.  Classic case for permanent sprot. The result, when sprot is in place, is the ability to conscientiously edit and improve the article (which has a changing base of facts so needs constant attention).  But rather than being able to easily evaluate substantive changes that responsible editors make, we are bogged down in having to go through screen after screen of pure and often vicious vandalism. For what positive reason, may I ask?

IP edits also can be used, I suppose, by regular editors who don't want to reveal that they are making sub rosa changes, but I would hope that is not going on here.  

And IP addresses have quite rarely reverted vandalism here - in fact I just looked at the last 500 edits and didn't see a single case of an IP address reverting vandalism. Maybe I missed one, but that claim was not really reflective of what goes on on this page - it is a very small group of actual editors who do the vast majority of the reverting.  

Your comment above about there being only one vandalism on Dec 21 was just one day after sprot was lifted the last time. I said then that I hoped to be wrong, but predicted that vandalism would be back up and it is.  That's why I requested extended protection.

If what  you were unhappy about is the tag itself, I also thought all along that we should have {{sprotect2}} and had thought to change it last time but the block was lifted before I had a chance to.   I have changed it to that less obtrusive tag.  The question of the duration  of the lock is what I am interested in. Two-three weeks is much better than what we had a few weeks ago, and may coincide with any announcement that Senator Obama makes which is also good timing for sprot, but  I'd like to understand why you would want it not to be an extended one, because I can't make any sense out of your position on this, as a person (you, I mean) who clearly is interested in having this remain a high quality page, as evidenced by the excellent work you do here, and the fact that this page has been by far your main area of Wikipedia editing.    | talk

You assume a lot. I don't """"support Storms,"""" it's not personal. Storms is reliable source of a kind that requires caution: he is clearly affiliated with cold fusion research. However, who should write a book on the topic? Someone who has no experience with it? Storms isn't simply editorializing, expressing his opinions, he shows the basis for those opinions with meticulously referenced text. As with any review of the field, he cites research according to his opinion of what is relevant, and this, then, gives us a guide to what is notable in the field. There are thousands of peer-reviewed papers on cold fusion, and even more  much more  if we allow conference papers. He can use conference papers, we can't, but if he cites them, that makes them sufficiently notable for our reference. Because of the position of the field as to """"general opinion""""  very unclearly defined  we have to present everything in the field as controversial, including what is quite well-established, such as excess heat. If you don't think excess heat is reasonably well-established, you should read the 2004 DoE review again, and I could cite reliable sources that the work is sound. The claim that it's all junk research, quite simply, can't be supported from any solid source, only from what are, really, tertiary sources as Hipocrite is now using at the article, in place of the much stronger Storms reference, which is a secondary source. It's like the media reports that Fleischmann's work was never replicated.

In fact, the core claim, that excess heat was found when setting up highly-loaded palladium deuteride, has been confirmed over and over. The original radiation claims were bogus. The research finding neutrons at moderate levels was bogus, artifact and error. The claim that the origin is nuclear, and in particular that it is """"fusion,"""" is unproven. In other words, OCMV, I'm quite with the 2004 DOE review, except that the field has shifted since then, the evidence for nuclear effect is stronger, a clear and consistent pattern has emerged from a review of all the research, such that negative replications typically, now, can be seen as confirmations of a general hypothesis forming, but no clear proof that the basic process is fusion.

For example, the SPAWAR group shows energetic neutrons. The work is solid and published. Aspects of it have been confirmed, and I am, indeed, assuming that there will be more confirmation; their work, over almost twenty years, has been quite solid and conservative, they've done proper controls, etc. The levels, however, are very low, and this kind of phenomenon has always been used as an argument against cold fusion: there are all these apparently contradictory experiments. I was just reading yesterday one protest that """"all these experiments produce different amounts of heat, how come there is no consistency?"""" """"So what if you find neutrons, this is inconsistent with the reported heat.""""

Actually, it isn't. What that shows is that neutrons aren't involved in whatever is generating the heat, but that the energy source, what I call the black box, is capable of creating conditions where a little hot fusion takes place. For example, take the Be-8 hypothesis. That will generate energetic alphas at 23.8 MeV. These can cause some hot fusion to take place at a low level, indeed, it would be expected. The alphas are found, confirmed, Miles et al's work showed, way back, that helium generation is correlated with excess heat. No excess heat, no helium. Excess heat, helium, in an amount proportional to the excess heat, and the ration is at 25 +/- 5 MeV, as reported by Storms and others. Krivit thinks this is a bogus figure, but I'm not convinced that Krivit understands the problem. If you don't capture all the helium, you will get a higher figure, and that is, indeed, what is found, but with some experiments, great care has been exercised to detect all the helium, and that gets us tightly toward the expected figure from d-d helium fusion, 23.8 MeV.

One writer put this way: Fleischmann didn't just discover some isolated island, that could be specified by simple coordinates, he found an entire continent, and those who try to find the island find different things, their reports vary all over the map, literally. We do not know to what extent low-energy nuclear reactions are possible. Storms details a list of observations that it would be desirable for a CF theory to explain. This does not mean that he thinks all these findings are artifact-free.

Elemental transformation under conditions that produce the excess heat phenomena is now quite well confirmed, overall. The field suffers from a lack of highly specific confirmation; this results from the conditions under which the work has been done.

Given a review of any say, month long period, I think we will find the same result within a few percentage points of the mean.
You made an obviously bad call about Protonk, a well respected and long term contributor to this project based on what you term a BLP violation. You state in your comments that this was supported by other admins when anyone who takes the time to actually go there and read the comments will see, that no one supported your decision. This caused a moderate admin to leave the project completely only to allow less moderate admins like yourself more room to exert influence. After reviewing the comment Protonk made, I certainly agree it was a bad comment, but it was absolutely not worthy of a block without any sort of warning or talk page message and it was no worse than your outburst of telling all the editors in an RFA they are Fucking morons"""" because you were the submitter of the RFA and likely had your feelings hurt. An event I note that you were not blocked nor even approached about and as far I can find have never openly apologized for. Although there may be a comment somewhere I do admit. 
You have a tendency to exaggerate in your favor such as can be seen in the previous statement when determining that there was support to summarily block Protonk when there clearly was nt. This can also be seen in reviewing some of the cases on your talk page and talk archives.
As mentioned above, and as noted by several individuals, your Fucking morons''' comment is still too new and does not represent the attitude needed or wanted of a functionary.
You recently unblocked  and revoked his topic ban knowing this user had a long history of Personal attacks and trolling regarding gender topics and gamergate. Within 24 hours that user was again blocked for personal attacks, has continued to stir the pot and make drama and has been drug to at least ANI and Arbcom within the last week as can be seen on their talk page and the mentioned venues.
Even based on your comments here, you clearly have an attitude of knowing better than everyone else whats good for Wikipedia. That arrogance is inappropriate of a functionary.
You give a staggering number of over 13000 blocks and claim it as an achievement. Personally, I see this as proof of your tendency to block first and ask questions later. There is no way you scrutinized all those and I can easily see a lot of mistakes and preventing useful edits from being done through bad faith assumptions of guilt, similar to those you displayed towards me for criticizing your actions.
I could keep going, but that is enough IMO to show a pattern of conduct not appropriate of a functionary. 96.255.237.170  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

654c5127a4232a53,"United Kingdom
I think the United Kingdom itself maybe be emerging to be an early 21st century super power with the US as the world hyper power. Here's the reasons for me thinking this:
Second to the US in world diplomacy
Second highest defence budget
Second largest navy in terms of tonnage
Second most power projection capability
Second largest aircraft carrier fleet with second largest aircraft carries being built after the Nimitz aircraft carriers
UN Security Council seat and founding member
Head of the Commonwealth of Nations (the largest organisation of states after the UN)
The British monarch is also Head of State of 15 other countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
Major player in NATO and EU
Large North Sea oil and gas production
London being one of the greatest cities in the world 
City of London being the world's main financial centre in terms of number of amount of money that passes through it each year and largest gathering of financial groups.
Pound Sterling one of the world's top currencies alongside US Dollar and Euro
Second highest growth for major developed economies after US.
Its own nuclear missiles on nuclear submarines which have joint longest range with US nuclear submarines
Largest number of over seas territories
Carried out major invasions of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. 
Was only the nation to actually invade Afghanistan and Iraq alongside US forces (Other forces came after US & UK forces had secured the countries)
Second largest force in Iraq and Afghanistan 
Leads the fight against Afghan rebels in Helmand province
Controls southern Iraq and large areas of Afghanistan
Leads NATO force in Kosovo
The leading nation in tackling global warming
A leading country in the Middle East road map to peace
Most involved in Darfur issue
Second most involved in Iran nuclear issue
Single handedly resolved Sierra Leone issue
I think since the end of the Cold War to present the United Kingdom has played the second largest role in the world after the United States, and after all the role a country plays in the world is what defines a super power. Also the United Kingdom demonstrated that it can single handedly and quickly defeat a regional power and quickly resolve a conflict when it won the Falklands War. This is more than what can be said for such countries as the United States or Former Soviet Union. After the Second World War and during the 1950s the United Kingdom was considered to be a super power because of the role it played in the world but the after effect of the Suez crisis made this disappear. The Falklands war and Thatcher-Reagen era displayed the UK was preparing to retrieve its status as being on the same level as the USA and USSR. Soon after this the Cold War ended and with no Soviet Union left to counter the United Kingdom in any way (like in the Suez crisis) the Thatcher-Reagen duo had worked and the United Kingdom set in motion activities to reclaim such a postion it had in the world that it had in the world before the Suez crisis in time for the beginning of the 21st century. The 1990s was a bit of a prelude to today and saw the United Kingdom slowly begin to prepare as being a power equal to the US and former USSR by being eager to greatly contribute to the Gulf War and and Yugoslav wars and grew more involed in Western Africa by sending troops there to resolve conflict in Sierra Leone and was testing its place as second most powerful in the world to the US and in being a semi super power again. Soon afterwards September 11th happened and the War on Terror that followed gave the United Kingdom just what it needed to reassert itself on the world stage and came just at the right time to have given the United Kingdom time to perpare and try out its future after the end of the Cold War and for the beginning of the 21st century. Today the United Kingdom is easily seen as being second most powerful on the world stage diplomatically and even militarily and could be called a semi super power. People have started to raise this issue called the British Moment in the 21st century. The United Kingdom also acts very much as a deciding force in NATO and the EU in which policy they take or their futures in whether it decides to side with the US or EU and can have an effect around the world. It also greatly influences the other 52 members of the Commonwealth of Nations which it heads by its monarch and is the largest body other than the UN.

Early Years
History
The band was formed in the February 6 2008 along with Foretance by Preston Joseph, Preston formed a band in 2007 with the same members in it except Sham Bahrin after he rest off his acting career, but the band didn’t work out well, cause the band was moving really fast, and the band members still doesn’t know how to play the instruments.

Preston has pursue his solo career for a try and he almost release his album but it was not succesful, and he formed a group named Foretance in February 6 2008 along with a new band named Boys Do Cry, the band consists the same members, and the band has abandoned the name of the band and performed at 4 Aces Studio without no name.

Preston searched for a name in a day, the name was suppose to be name after a japanese god of destruction but it may corrupt their religion of islam. The band later posted a few novel names in the internet, and let the worldwide people vote which is the best name, there are 6 names, Mirza took Agent To The Stars (by John Scalzi), Morning Star (by Simon Raven), and more, but there are 11 votes on Agent To The Stars, which led the band to take the name.",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 """"no you're wrong, it's perfect acceptable. . . ."""" 

Hello,

I always welcome feedback for my efforts, most of which nowadays are editing and writing narrative nonfiction and novels.

And I do appreciate those who have studied the art and science of the English language, esp. grammar and usage. 

I especially love it when those who would criticize another's work do it decently and respectfully.

Having listened to the tone, color and texture of your message, I assume that you're not one of those I describe in paragraph two above. Further, I assume you're not diplomatic in your dealings with other people, in general. Either that, or you're just plain too lazy to be kind and decent. 

Telling me I'm """"wrong"""" is just plain rude, esp. when BOTH of us are correct, according to modern-day usage.

By the way, the correct way your sentence should've been structured is, """"No, you're wrong; it's perfectly acceptable."""" Of course, I may've said something like, """"You're both right, Dean. Happy editing and thank you for contributing to Wkipedia.""""

Of course, that's just I . . . or me, as it were. . . .

I wish you well in your future edits.

Take care,

Dean Garner

I think that it is important to mention national syndicalism at the beginning, as that eliminates a good amount of the problems with temporality associated with some of the more generalizing and overarching terms that have been suggested.
As for the left-right thing, it should be apparent that national syndicalism itself was a nationalistic movement, but the economics they embraced were not generally what would be considered """"right wing"""". I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements, but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff (i.e., totalitariansm, etc.), and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology. Neither of those is contradictory to the lead. Fascism arose during a fragmentary, transitional period, and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements. It's probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to """"national syndicalism"""" should facilitate, than oversimplify.
Regarding the deleted material, I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context (and sourcing). It should be borne in mind that the WWII-era fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasi-fascist Japan formed the """"axis"""", for example, so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me, though ethnocentrism sounds plausible. Just because it sounds plausible, however, does not mean that there are RS describing it as such. Militarism is a common thread, but how does monumental architecture relate to that?

Creationism is the explanation  that the universe and all life were created by the deliberate act of God.

In looking through the historical record at the competition between creation and evolution in Darwin's day, I was impressed by Thomas Huxley's 1887 account of how Origin of Species provided the first explanation that in Huxley's view was a better explanation than creation.  Huxley describes the sense in which he rejected creation as an explanation.

If Agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the explanation explained. 

Huxley describes his similar rejection of the explanations of the evolutionists prior to Darwin.

And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. . . . [A] thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 1852. . . . Many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. I took my stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favor of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable. 

Furthermore, any self-respecting religion-neutral anthropologist, such as Robert L. Carneiro, Curator of the American Museum of Natural History, would classify creation and evolution as mere successive stages of incomplete but improving explanations in a universe where there is no God to assist the women and men who attempt to discover the truth of their origins. 

From all of the above, I suggest that it is more accurate to define creationism as an explanation rather than a belief.  After all, the survival of the belief derives from the usefulness of the belief, and a primary use of creationism is explaining how we all got here.  According to Thomas Huxley, until Origin of Species, creationism was as good an explanation as evolutionism.  And for the majority of American voters who cannot understand the evolutionists' explanations, creationism is a better explanation than evolutionism even yet today.  - 16:08, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

 Considering that """"Belief in the psychological sense is a representational mental state that takes the form of a propositional attitude and in the religious sense, belief refers to a part of a wider spiritual or moral foundation, generally called faith, and that creationism is part and parcel of the christian faith, I think the use of the term """"belief"""" was completely justified. Creationism is indeed an explanation, but it is an explanation founded on belief, hence it is a belief. It is not founded on knowledge or evidence; to imply otherwise, which is what you're doing, is to create a false impression that Creationism shares some sort of parity with other explanations which do not require belief in the supernatural. It does not. You seem to be substituting your own personal bias for this imputed """"evolutionist bias"""" you claim is on the Creationism page.  16:48, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Hey Dirk. You gave a good answer to my question concerning the Roman tactics of bringing provinces into the Empire, and I read your similar question, and I may have an answer for you. There are a couple of major reasons as to twhy Alexander was able to take his army so far in so short a time. Alexander had the advantage of inheriting a great army from his father, and the Macedonian Empire saturated with, I believe, silver.

Another major factor was the Persians  they had a large army of hundreds of thousands, mostly conscripted agaist their will and treated very poorly.

nearly all the european nationals teams have flags above there names including England and world champions Spain , why are you deleting the africans nationals teams flags and not the europeans teams ? you are trouble maker just go away and i am considering reporting you.

dfd4d5541b8a4f4c,"""The main theory I have come across in relation to Lilith is about belief.  If a person believes the Bible is the word of God then it cannot be wrong.  So, if the Bible states in Gen 1:27:

 """"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them,"""" 

and then in Gen 2:7:

 """"then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature,"""" 

followed by Gen 2:21:

 """"So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.""""

These passages contradict one another.  The first states man and woman being created together.  The second two have Adam being created first, followed by Eve.  If a person believes that the Bible is the word of God then both are correct.  So, to make them both correct there has to be a first woman followed by Eve.  Which is how the idea of Lilith came about - filling in the gaps to make both versions true.  If a person believes the Bible is the inspired word of God, written by men capable of error, there is no need for Lilith.

 Stub sorting guidelines 
I sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting, and really provide a guideline.  I believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by April 2, 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow.  Once we have built a set of guidelines, we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines.  We need to define what a specialized topic stub is, how many articles it should cover, when is it appropriate to create it, what defines its need for its creation, what defines its need for deletion, what criteria it should follow, what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub, whether or not to start using subst: for all templates, whether or not use subst: for all templates created by the meta-templates, and any other matters that may come up in consideration.  I thank  for initially creating the subpage for the project at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  Even though they have been discussed, I feel that we really need to confirm everything.  For that, we should discuss each issue with its own sections, and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on.  The English Wikipedia is nearly at 500k articles.  Either the MediaWiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories, or the sorting is done manually by Wikipedians.  Personally, I think the latter is less taxing on the server load, especially when we use subst:, which I think would help the Wikipedia out, performance wise.  Please make your comments at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  I apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice, but since the project has more members, the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand.  (talk) 23:23, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

That thing you did
‘’Hi Gadfium - a while back I was having trouble with some geography stubs, and (via the Village Pump) you found out for me that they'd been created twice, and fixed them. What did you do?’’
Just delete and restore the article which is appearing more than once. If that doesn't seem to work, try refreshing the category that they're in (edit the category page and then change the URL to say refresh instead of edit), and as a last resort, make a trivial change to the duplicated article to force a change to the database.  01:47, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

The db may be the culprit. These stubs are very heavily used and the system does seem to slow down a bit with them. Not sure why that would result in the multile template changes though.

Request For Mediation In Removing Mclellan and The Marine Corps From Manookian's Page [Armenian Issues]
I have tried to informally resolve the editing issues on Arman Manookian to no avail. As a matter of fact, I requested mediation with no response. Moreover, a consensus of Assisting Editors informed me, when I tried to include Arman Manookian on the List of Historically Notable Marines, that Arman Manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of Marine Corps History. Based on that guidance, I deleted references to McClellan [a Marine Corps Historian] on Manookain's page. Now, I note, the very same editors who opined that Manookian did not warrant inclusion on the List of Historically Notable Marines, insist on including McClellan's name and the Marine Corps on Manookian's page for propaganda purposes. I have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from Manookian's accomplishments independent of the United States Marine Corps History. It appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to Armenians. Moreover, 3 linked references to McClellan and the Marine Corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about. Is it about Manookian or Mclellan or the United States Marine Corps? Although I am assuming Good Faith, several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of Bias for a POV and propaganda. I don't believe Mediation is consistent with an Editing War. Moreover, as I stated before in assuming Good Faith, it appears as though Manookian's page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the Marine Corps. Yet when simple solutions are offered, such as including Manookian and McClellan on the List of Historically Notable Marines, it is ignored because his last name ends in IAN and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr. Despite the fact that on the Editor Assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered, I followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason Manookian was taken off the List of Historically Notable Marines was because he was a clerk and McClellan only said nice things about [his name and fame are intertwined with it [Marine Corps History]] him because he felt sorry that Manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first Marine Corps historical artist/illustrator. I followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well.  This type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized. Moreover, there seems to be a concerted effort by so-called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on Marine Corps History that have a problem with historically notable Marines whose last names end in IAN or who volunteered for suicide missions. Apparently, it has something to do with recruitment of Armenians for Martyrdom during WWII and the Marine Corps' subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same Armenian American Marines for political and financial reasons. At this point I ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an Armenian American Marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers.   00:44, 10",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Hi there,  

One of my current projects is working on turning the article about Adrienne Clarkson the former Governor General of Canada into a featured article.  While doing this I snapped some screenshots of a young Clarkson hosting The Fifth Estate during the 1970's.  When I sat down to do some hacking at the article today and finally added one of the screencaps (I have 8 loaded onto wikipedia, they are all sitting in her talkpage waiting to be implemented) I found they had been taged as orphaned because they have yet to be used in any articles themselves.  There is currently a photo gallery on her page but I figured it would be better to but (mostly repetative) images in her talk page so as to not slow down the page loading.  It took a while to get around to this project because a) Im in the middle of exam season and b) the article is currently listed in nomination for Canadian Colaboration of the Week.  Im am going to take the tag off the images for now and after this project is completed any unused shows can be deleted.  Is this acceptable ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

I think that one of the confounding issues is what to name what Einstein called """"spooky action at a distance."""" The idea of action involves the application of some force over some amount of time, and our ordinary idea of """"causing something"""" involves exerting force on some system to influence its behavior. But entanglement is exhibited without the lag that would be required were interactions at a velocity ≤ c, so something is going on that is not """"causal"""" in the usual sense. On the other hand, before one or the other entangled twin particles is measured, they both have the freedom or the potential to manifest either spin, and after one of them is measured and must manifest a spin then the other no longer has the freedom or potential to manifest any spin other than the opposite of the one that was first measured. So something has changed, and it strikes me as creating an intellectual smokescreen to say that there is only some kind of abstract """"correlation"""" involved. Like the """"collapse"""" of a wavefunction, we have no idea of what is going on or how to describe it. All we know is that it happens. It also strikes me as possibly significant that the time sequence may not be clear. From my frame of reference, electron A is observed first, and electron B is observed second. Someone else, in another frame of reference, may see electron B as being observed first and electron A as being observed second. There are also phenomena within the same frame of reference that we call retrocausal. We have no way of knowing that the discovery of the polarity of photon B at time T+n determines, retrocausally, the polarity of photon A at time T. If we say that these changes are not local, that must  (I think) mean that they are not local in space-time. So, in a sense, I end up arguing against my own discomfort with the idea that there is """"only"""" a correlation between the discovered states of any entangled twins.

d22ac35725b0a535,"""About Claim of POV and grammar errors for this article==

To: speedoflight

Your claim of POV and grammar error are not clear and not helpful. For instance, I cannot see what's wrong with the sentence: """"As a versatile actor, Cheung also acted in many comedies."""" With all the different types of roles and movies he acted, it is proper to call him a versatile actor. In addition, all the movies talked in the same paragraph are comedies. As the names of movies are already given, people can easily check out by either checking the movie itself or going to imdb or any other movie related website. Neither is there any grammar error in this short sentence. Without this sentence, the whole paragraph became confusing and ridiculous. In addition, I keep telling you that Cheung's niece never explicitly said in his funeral that Cheung was suffered from depression. This can be verified by the video record of his funeral published by Cheung's family. However, you stick on introducing this mistake again and again. In addition, Ouyang Feng's job in the movie Ashes of Time is killer agent instead of assassin, this is easy to verify as the movie's name is given in the article. I don't know why you change it to the wrong one. You also remove the movie link of Happy together. I can't see any of these revisions made by you have anything to do with POV or Grammar error.

As for the subtitle """"Golden Age in Film"""", it is just to address the blooming period of Cheung's Film career. Changing to """"Height in career"""" did not show anything about Film. If you want to change it to something else, at least you should not ruin the meaning. I can see that you are very anti-Chinese media. However, You should not bring personal feeling in editing. I can understand and am tolerant with Chinese media doesn't mean I would trust them. In fact, I am trying to dig out references not just from news media, but also books and original interviews, which make the job time consuming.

Again, it's no problem and you are definitely welcome to do editing. However, you need to be careful not introduce new mistakes in the article. In addition, please explain you point clear for others to understand and check outAugest 

I keep telling you to be patient as I am still in my process to finger out a better way to put references and resources staff. However, you keep removing things in all kinds of excuses, introducing tons of mistakes, and making the article ambiguous. If you want to put whatever references you want, go ahead and do it. Or if anything you consider as needed a reference, EXPLICITLY POINTED OUT. Don't just rudely remove things with ridiculous reasons. Not """"EVERY"""" piece of sentence needs a reference, otherwise ALL articles in wiki should be removed. I spent THREE months to verify the information, correct errors and finish the current article. To dig out all the original resources may need another 3 months. I also need break during the Christmas season. Please be patient!!! Augest 

Please don't remove background or useful information when you do """"gramma"""" corrections. Augest 

I think it's better to put Chinese version of Cheung's suicide note in his Chinese version wiki page to reduce redundancy. However, I don't have time to do it yet.

As for the references, I am still trying to think a better way to include them, as there are too much about him, please be patient. Thank you for the suggestions though! Augest

The eastern Montana thing is going to be tricky; there was a boom just like now in the 70s-80s, and a subsequent crash, the pattern is significant, not necessarily a permanent thing. Will take proper research to do that bit justice  and if anyone does a """"shoutout"""" to Sidney, but not Miles City, Glendive, Glasgow or maybe even Baker and Wibaux, (and, of course, Ekalaka!) we will be in all sorts of trouble! (grin)  Plus, at the moment, with that murder out in Sidney, the place is coming under a lot of scrutiny for the boomtown atmosphere, and so I suggest we tread delicately.  (talk) 

 Article Structure 

Okay, so there seems to be no basic consensus on how this article should be structured.  I can't find an outline in the wikiprojects sections, so I am going to attempt to make one based on the the only three states at FA-Class Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Virginia and the nearest GA-Class article, South Dakota.  Yes, we're being beaten by South Dakota.  Here is my suggestion: 

Etymology — (see OK's) — Short description of where the name Montana comes from
Geography — (see SD's) — General descriptions about size and location
Geology and terrain — Junk about east v west, mountains, rivers, etc.  Just not a bunch of lists
Flora and fauna — kind of obvious; may need to break state into regions  
Climate
Protected lands — State and national parks, I guess.
History — Summarize and send off to the History of Montana page
American Indian reservations — Brief overview and description of the Indian reservations in Montana.  Could be linked here until a separate page can be made.
Cities and Towns — (See OK's) — Briefly describe the make-up of Montana's cities and towns.  Not a giant list. There's already one here, just send people there.  Really, only those with more than 50,000 should be listed on this page, but given that doesn't even include the capital we may as well go down to Kalispell at around 20,000 (i.e. the largest seven).  No other town even has 10,000.  We're not exactly waiting up on election night for the Havre votes to come in.
Demographics — Basic census crap written in prose
Population
Ancestry
Religion
Economy
Culture — (see OK's and (VA's))
Arts and theatre — We have plenty of museums and theatres across the state.  You could list the most important ones first, but eventually they need to be put into prose.
Festivals and events — Ditto
Sports and recreation
Organized sports — Probably mostly college sports and minor league baseball.  Could add state games and skiing competitions I guess.
Outdoor recreation — hiking, fishing, mountain biking, skiing, etc.
Government and politics — (see OK's)
State government
Local government
Tribal government
National Politics
Education — School districts, administration, universities/colleges, etc.
Media — (see OK's and SD's) — Links to lists should be okay, but here only the largest and prominent should be mentioned as well as Nielsen zones, etc.
Health — (see VA's and OK's) — MT's healthcare system, stats, and perhaps main hospitals.
Transportation — (see OK's) — Basic info from the MDOT on our roads, train stations, and airports.  And, the basic health of our transportation system.
State symbols — (see VA's)

Any Comments?
  

Thanks for the list, Dsetay  (you forgot to sign it above) No question the article is not of good quality and needs to be improved.  I don't have a lot of time to devote to this, but I'd support and offer minor assistance to an improvement drive. The Oklahoma or Minnesota articles would probably be the best guides, as both have notable Native American populations and are more or less in the west.  SD would be fine to fill in gaps, but GA being a less fussy standard than FA, I'd split any debates in favor of an FA structure.  [[User talk:Montanabw|",0,0,0,0,0,0,False

But then again, a theory need not be academic to be notable. For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions).

Byrgenwulf complains that """"we chaps"""" are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan's assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. 

It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  

By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. 

This conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to take his demands seriously.

Sophie Calle is a disturbing character. Artist known as """"unclassable"""", its autobiographical works cause polemic. It is a photographer but almost never its photographs itself takes, it makes its life a work of art by using the others, and spaces it few days becomes a character of novel. Its most known series of photographs is that of the """"Blind men"""". By always combining the text and the image, it photographs blind men of birth and their request to express their vision of the beauty.  With the limit of the indiscretion, Sophie Calle often takes risks to work out her settings in scene. She follows people in the street to photograph them, she posed as a maid in a Venetian hotel to inspect and photograph the personal effects of customers. Works of Sophie Calle are diverse. The context in which the texts and photographs fit makes it possible to often qualify them """"artistic performance"""". The public is often shocked by Calle's works. Along with primary shock and disapproval, morals are often mandated to be discarded in appreciating the innovating works of Sophie Calle.

Judging from its terrible grammar, syntax and diction (and use of """"its"""" where """"her"""" should be, for example), this seems to be a machine translation from an unreferenced French source.

For example the reference you put are biased on one openion and in one direction that is Anti Ahmadiyya websites. How can some one claim that the material which is published on Ahmaiyya site is edited..even if it is edited to suit something, we must accept it as an Official point of view of a community, we dont have to agree with it, but we have to accept it as Official point of view. So if you put some information from an Anti Ahmadiyya web site it will be biased as on the official web site you dont find this information, the best informaiton will be if we can match this information on both sides, other wise, regardless true or false, it will remain Biased and that is against the Policy of Wikipedia. That is why i have suggested earlier that there is no restriction on puting information on open plate form like Wikipedia, but instead of puting on this artical there are other artical where this information can be put it. For example, there are Artical like Islam and Quran, but Critism on Islam is a totally different Artical, so the Islam Poisition is defined in Islam Artical, but Critism was defined in other Artical. If a Bio Artical like Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is a Bio Artical, the Critism or his so called failed Prophecies, will not suit for this Artical. You can even creat a new Artical more suitable to the title and information against him or his Community. This will be more sources, more reliable and athenticated rather called Biased and may be reverted repeatedly.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.

After the Napoleonic Wars, Egypt and the North African maghreb became increasingly ungovernable from Istanbul, the resort of pirates under local beys, and as Europe industrialized, an increasingly prized potential for colonization. The Maghreb had far greater proven wealth than the unknown rest of Africa and a location of strategic importance affecting the exit from the Mediterranean. For the first time, Morocco became a state of some interest in itself to the European Powers. France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830. Recognition by the United Kingdom in 1904 of France's sphere of influence in Morocco provoked a German reaction; the crisis of June 1905 was resolved at the Algeciras Conference, Spain in 1906, which formalized France's """"special position"""" and entrusted policing of Morocco to France and Spain jointly. A second Moroccan crisis provoked by Berlin, increased tensions between European powers. The Treaty of Fez (signed on March 30, 1912) made Morocco a protectorate of France.

Ms. Barber said: """"Well, to start with, there are """"recognized"""" registries, like the AKC, CKC, UKC, SV, UK and various other breed club registries recognized under the FCI.""""

Ms. Barber said: """"I am sure that the TSSR, NSBR, SSBA, etc. have convinced themselves that they *are* registries, but I can also assure you that no other legitimate organization, like the UKC .. AKC .. FCI .. etc. would agree with them!! Just because someone says something (and it's not illegal) that does not *make* it so!!"""" 

Jareth: (see above) Ms. Barber has repeatedly and continuously made personal attacks about other registries and should be banned by you for doing so.  She should be subject to the same rules/restrictions to which the other contributors to this discussion have been held. Wiki has not allowed others to address Ms. Barber's questionable registry/club/breeding practices, so why is she being allowed to continue to do so? 

And, despite being the """"first"""" registry, what independent, unbiased documentation has the ISSR provided to show that they are any """"different"""" or more """"recognized"""" than any other Shiloh registry, when it comes to accreditation by any outside organization. The fact of the matter is, the ISSR is no more """"recognized"""" independently than any of the other Shiloh registries currently in operation.

Also, like the 'self' proclaimed registries Ms. Barber references, the ISSR also issues its own """"pieces of paper"""" based on Ms. Barber's own determination and her registry charge for these """"pieces of paper"""".  What Ms. Barber is claiming about other registries (""""Just because someone says something [and it's not illegal] that does not *make* it so!!""""), is true of her own, as she has repeatedly throughout this discussion failed to provide unbiased, independent (as you stipulated as a rule for the inclusion of information or contribution) corroboration that her organization is any different.

In addition, the article, as now changed again, with Ms. Barber's numerous links to her own registry's/club's website are again both self-promoting and an attempt to steer readers to her business and to hinder Wikipedia's policy of """"neutrality"""" in its articles.  These links are not unbiased, factual, neutral information.  Readers wishing to pursue more information re: her club/registry have the link at the bottom of the article (along with the other registry/club links) they can access if they want to hear more from her.

At this stage, I think it is obvious that Ms. Barber has no intention of negotiating and compromising, in good faith and mutual respect, a """"neutral"""", factual, independent, unbiased article.

Hi Nehrams hope your studies are going well and are off on vacation. First have you ever considered some new parameters to the film template -including genre, art direction, casting, second unit director, costume design for example. Also do you think its worth setting up a branch of film WPFilms/Westerns to conentrate on improving western film articles -I know a number of members who would be interested. 

You'll be pleased to know I have created two new templates for film images  these include  Template:Filmrationale  (for screenshots and posters)  and Template:Filmbiorationale (for all deceased film people). I regularly upload many images and it is SOOO! much easier. It has been long awaited and already many users are beginning to use them. For normal bios use Template:Biorationale

I have noticed a crackdown on images to the point that it is seriously affectig our articles, For instance Cinema of the UNited States looks ridiculous with no images. Surely there is even an image of CHarlie Chaplin which is publuic domain? I really hope our images will remain including our main film reel icons which were supposed to be deleted July 1.

I have begun an enormous task of compiling the list of American films in which I have asked the project to help out. Any contribution even if it is adding one or two details particularly 1960-present is really needed. 

Hope you are well and await your response   """"Expecting you"""" Contribs """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

The editor who fears that the inclusion of facts about Oswald's claim of being made a patsy by the use of fabricated evidence and then being silenced by murder, has received support from another editor by the name of  Mr. Harris. (See, above) Mr. Harris argues the beliefs there was a plot to kill the president, and that Oswald was set up, is similar to believing the earth is flat. 

No Mr. Harris, you are out of step with the modern world. In 1979, a Congressional Committee engaged in a three year study and determined that Kennedy was probably murdered as a result of a conspiracy, and in 2003 only 22% of Americans agree with you. Mr. Harris, you are clinging to the past in the face of overwhelming information to the contrary that is slowly being made public as more and more documents are declassified.  Sometimes one has to question old beliefsnot try to delete facts from books that disprove ones old beliefs. 

Congress enacted federal legislation in 1992 to open up the mass of secret government records about the assassination. The Assassination Records Review Board points out that not many people agree with Mr. Harris:

""""The American public has expressed its dissatisfaction with both the work and the conclusions of the official investigations of the assassination and it was this dissatisfaction that was primarily responsible for Congress' initiative to establish the Assassination Records Review Board (Review Board). Section 3(2) of the JFK Act defines the records of each of these official investigative entities as assassination records. As such, the Review Board worked to review and release all records that these investigative entities used in reaching their conclusions about the assassination.""""

Mr. Harris it won't help you cause to argue that everyone but you is dumb, a """"flat-earth believer"""", or must be sheltered from the facts. Please, just stop deleting facts from the articles. The old viewpoint that you want to believe is in the article. But, you’re not
satisfied. You want to keep out the evidence that makes your position to look improbable, but the web site rules forbid you deleting such information.

The Kincaid Family originated ALL-OVER Europe.

ive posted this on the clairvoyance talk page after someone completely removed the clar#irsentience article which had gone through a process of months of work , rewrites , endless discussion , removasl of personal matereal , edits for style and content .... endless work on correct sourcing and wikpedia referencing and formatting.....  the article which had been arrived at with co operation and discussion over many weeks and v man who himself put some hours into grammer , punctuation ... re editting for stlye and content ... and much help in correct sourcing and referencing  ..... 

this article was the sum  of many peoples input , effort and hard work  so i dont know how or who removed it so thoughtlessly and put the meaningless redirect to the clairvoyance page... any help would be great.... cheers.. 

hi guys

i see youve redirected  the clairsentience article.... let me ask....what was the point of the weeks of discussions and rewrites if you guys were going to redirect it anyway....you should have told me t get lost out of here...... what was the point of it all?  why did i listen to you ? at all?  why did i remove all personal references?  why did i reference and source all of my matereal diligently and in great detail ?  why did i edit and re edit for style and content ?  why did i make additional references to religios , anthropological ,socialogical , philosophical ,medical , physics , chemistry , botany , mental health etc  so that all views were included and respected?  why did i fulfill all of the above hurdles and hoops to fulfill wikpedia formatting and guidlines for you too to delete months of hard work and effort.  your actions are without integrity or honour .....
clairsentience article redirect ?

Hi ..... whoever removed the clairsentience article and made it redirect ... can you please try and respect that the article that was there had evolved over a couple of months of discussion and many rewrites and multiple edits which involved much discussion over a long period......
.........i could delete this clairvoyance article.... but i wont because revert and delete wars then stupidly take place   which is a real shame when a library becomes a bar room brawl......

..... i hope you can respect the clairsentience article...

..... ive been clairsentient for most of my adult life and it wasnt easy to come this far and to struggle for  decades to articulate my experience in a way which makes rational sense to the world at large of which the clairsentience article is a manifest example..... so please try and respect the vast amount of struggle and work which has gone into it....

 Borisoglebsk 2 

After testing of the new Russian """"anti-high-tech"""" Borisoglebsk 2 in Ukraine, this new Russian weapon system appears to jam all communication as well as GPS-system. Hence a question about all other """"high-tech"""" weapon rises. This has suddenly frightened American military as well as NATO. According to (a right wing) Swedish morning newspaper, with good international reputation.
I can't see what was undue in my contibution. Can America just take it for granted that F-35 can't be stopped by Borisoglebsk 2 ? It doesn't seem so to me. OK it's early days still, but fact is neither the American Airforce or NATO know if the Borisoglebsk 2 system will make the F-35 inoperable. But EMP pulses from huge nuclear detornations and from the sun is no news. Neither is jamming. I think all possible counter weapons belongs to the weapon article. (Also if/when an anti-Borisoglebsk 2 weapon is invented.) 
Generally ,if the best assult weapon can be made inoperable by a even better defence system, such matters goes together. And it's not I who ask whether the F-35 stands up towards the Borisoglebsk 2, according to the source, ist it NATO and America who wonders. (Presumably Russia as well)   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

 Unprotect Augusto Pinochet - See Talk:Augusto Pinochet. Veriverily isn't explaining his objections to text he keeps reverting over and over again.  
The page is already protected. Is this a request for unprotection?  
Yes, please unprotect this page.  
Sorry, but in spite of your efforts I don't think the discussion has reached enough of a resolution right now to avoid a resumption of the revert war as soon as the page is unprotected.  
Veriverily only chooses to lodge personal attacks against me as long as he manages to censor any facts that he feels might reflect negatively on the U.S. by means of a page protection. There cannot be a discussion unless the page protection is lifted. If we have to wait for Veriverily, the page might as well be protected permanently.  
Refer to the large number of people who have put effort into this article - Ed Poor, Cadr, Cantus, Eloquence - while 172 seeks to sabotage our efforts at working together and impose his own agenda.  The Talk pages are available, so one can see 172 is lying.  Although I have aired my frustration with 172 several times there, the issues have also been much discussed by me and others (i.e., """"only"""" yeah right).  As Cadr said on this very page ,  """"Agree with VV. A lot of constructive work was being done on the page; the problems are almost enitrely down to the user he mentions."""" (in ref to 172)  As soon as the protection is off, 172 will continue his activities.  V

Unprotect Augusto Pinochet. Cadr and Veriverily refuse to back down one inch, and no one else seems to be paying any attention. Is this page just going to be protected indefinitely?  

See brief discussion below and, for the patient, that at Talk:Augusto Pinochet.  It tells a very different story. - V 
To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote.  All other parties have written several draft intros each to try to accommodate objections and concerns.  172 dismisses these efforts as """"partisan bickering"""" and """"bullshit"""". - V 
Veriverily's comments are misleading at best. """"All other parties,"""" according to Veriverily, are the users (Cadr, EdPoor, AstroNomer, and himself) voting in the minority in the most recent round of polling. His preferred version does not have a """"consensus"""" behind it. This was really the winning position in the poll: """"Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial.""""  
Consensus had been reached before 172 started trolling; the poll was started afterwards and brought in random buddies of 172.  The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically.  Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering.  Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote. Nor was I voting """"ideologically"""", rather my vote was determined by my familiarity with the issues. Perhaps instead of attacking anyone who voted differently from him V V should present more compelling arguments  

Who am I attacking?  And saying I """"should present more compelling arguments"""" supports my supposition that you were not aware of the talk of these issues, because if so you would have seen the thousands and thousands of words arguing these very points. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote, I wasn't voting """"ideologically"""" and I have made (minor) contributions to the article.
 

Regardless of who the poll may have """"brought in"""", I think part of the purpose of listing this page at Wikipedia:Requests for comment, where it has appeared quite regularly for a while, is to """"bring in"""" opinions from members of the community.

 I contend that in the first section, yes Legalese makes a valid point that he does majorly include points to support his edits also, but my assertion that the second section (""""Be civil IAF"""") is meant solely for a personal attack. It merely has the cloak of redundant information i.e. which was already posted earlier by Legalese in another section, and its main aim (as the title itself suggests) is to lecture me about what he percieves is """"civility"""". On this, Legalese definitely deserves a warning .

Again, I may repeat that I have dealt with utmost consternation AND with due respect (while mentioning the Hon'ble SC) my opinion on the judgement which may qualify as Contempt of Courtsomething which Legalese has not and probably does not even bother to looking on the Talk-page. The purpose of repeatedly levelling baseless charges of Contempt of Court, despite my clarification on the same in the talk-page earlier is beyond my comprehension.

The charge that I am not being a """"good"""" editor can only be levelled as a matter of opinion only, (which I too can leve back at him) and not as a complaint because Legalese is NOT an admin, has no authority, has had no authority on wikipedia on matters related to the judgement of the quality of articles, and even final arbitration on what constitutes as """"good editing"""" or """"Objectionable behaviour"""".

His lecture to me on civility (that too publicly on a talk-page and not on my user:page) is itself very appaling to me-who has been contributing to wikipedia since more than a year now. What is even more appaling is his assumption of a role as the Moral Guardian and as someone who discerns the quality of edits. For attempting to accuse me of AND impose the norms of """"civility"""" and that too incongruous on a talk-page of an article and not personally on my own talk-page, Legalese deserves a warning.

 THF 

I have not perused Wikipedia lately, but when I did, I saw some cooler (and sane) heads have seemingly prevailed, including yours.

THF was the first AEI director I had the misfortune to encounter.  When he saw my edits, which he didn't like, he came after me with a vengeance, and lobbied for me to be banned on Wikipedia.  He defamed me on his talk site (yes, I am aware of the meaning of the word, since I also am an attorney).   It was defamation - libel, to be exact -  and removed after a time, when I threatened suit.  I know Wiki doesn't like that - but it reaps what it sows.    THF  threatened me and my husband with frivolous litigation OUTSIDE of Wikipedia, and we called him on it.  We never heard from him again.
At that time, Wiki cliques would not or could not listen to what I had to say, and what had occurred.  I have no idea if I am """"banned"""" or not, and don't care at this point.  After the Kafkaesque experience, I never want to edit again here.  That said, I am grateful that you and it appears some others were able to expose him for what he is - even if it took a different issue entirely.  (I had no particular interest in the Michael Moore debate).

The AEI is one of the most powerful political influences in the Republican party.    THF was quite an eye-opener for me.  Rarely have I ever seen anyone so ruthlessly disparage others, with false """"information"""".  I can only guess what he does """"professionally"""".   THF is a public figure.  His attempt to hide out at Wikipedia claiming it was only a """"hobby"""" was laughable.  It was astonishing that anyone fell for it, but many did.

Ground instruction airframes are not notable unless there is some special reason, for example if the airframe itself is notable from earlier in its life. 
Re. the ordering of the list, I would have to think about that but it is really a separate discussion. 
You say that the serial numbering (tail numbering) uses a special system. I would like to see this system explained, but it needs just a few examples to show the principles, not the whole list.
If Swiss writers routinely quote the serial number of an aircraft when writing about it, as a way of showing the information contained in the number, then you should be able to reference this. Such references might convince us that the Swiss Air Force is an exception to the general rule. We Wikipedia editors do like to see hard evidence, not just another editor's word. And, as you have noticed, we sadly know little of the Swiss Air Force unless someone can find reliable sources for us. — Cheers,  (Talk)

Again, you disgusting cretin, you accuse my statements of being laughable, yet have no logical basis to believe so. You think I believe my arguments are gospel, eh? So you're the kind of person who believes that if everybody believes something, then you should go along with them? So you're the kind of sick bastard that would've condoned slavery just because everybody you knew did? I do not at all think my arguments are gospel, I just proudly stand by my word until a logical argument will present a sensical contradiction. You're the bastard who has some sort of personal agenda attatched to this and for some reason or another, you refuse to have it changed, like a no-good dirty hippocrite.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

About the Standard English, obviously, this article was written by a British person, and is extremely POV, thus is not a valid argument against this issue. That's like basing all your knowledge about drugs on government and anti-drug propaganda.

I assume good faith. It seems simply an act of confusion. 

Why would you assume good faith with this person, but not with me?   
You dismiss my perspective as """"nonsense and bullshit"""" and a cursory browsing of your Talk page reveals this is a somewhat common response, on your part, to DisagreementViolations of WP Tenants certainly as bad as those you cast at this newbie.

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!""""

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

YA BOI! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grindcore and Deathcore isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of AID's.
